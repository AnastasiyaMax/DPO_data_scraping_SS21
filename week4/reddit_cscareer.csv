I got rejected for- having a reddit account and being unbelievably stupid.   
I am Senior software engineer and was interviewing for a startup which just got huge funding. I got through first 4 rounds.  
Now here comes the last Engineering manager round. I was pretty confident. He asked me two Leetcode hard problems and I was able to do both. For the next question he asked me to open Reddit. Pretty weird, right ? Basically he just wanted to show me how reddit/subreddits/subcomments looks and design a database for it.  
Here comes the stupid part- I opened reddit from the browser I had logged in with my personal account. He asked me to open a post and to my great luck, all the usernames in that post were similar to these - pusyman34, hairylicker, largenuts. And he was trying to explain me how he needs me to design a database with these users. I was barely controlling my laughter at that moment. I started designing database and so far interview was going pretty interactive but now he kind of got distracted and started to check something else on his computer. He wasn't focussing on anything I was saying and he was just replying ""Yeah sure, it will work"". 10 minutes into the question and he suddenly said -""okay I think I am done here."" I was answering all his questions, we had still 30 mins left and this guy wanted to leave the discussion. Then it hit me like a train. He must have seen my username, searched my account and must have been seeing my posts and comments. And my account was just posts about trolling and hating corporate, 9-5, managers and whole software world basically.  
Interview Result - Rejected  
Feedback- LLD knowledge not up to mark(I was not asked a single question on LLD in any of my interview)   
My reddit account - now deleted

Edit- Some of you are thinking interviewer asked me to open my reddit account. No, he asked me to open reddit. I was the dumbass who opened it in the browser I was logged in."

"Few months into my first job, did I screw up by taking a ""support"" role?",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nwjm4v/few_months_into_my_first_job_did_i_screw_up_by/,[],0.85,1623347105.0,"On title, I was hired as a junior developer/SWE but I was placed into a support role. Specifically a primarily L3 Support role.

But here's the thing, I can't help but to feel like I'm playing second fiddle to the actual production teams, as in I'm not even a real dev outside of my title and even having a twinge of envy in other juniors that was placed into production. It's been hammered in by everyone that I know that I fucked up by being a support engineer and would have trouble transitioning to a real SWE role.

I plan to stay here for a while, just because of the job market here for entry roles and I can't afford not having a job.

My daily responsibilities pretty much involve me staring at the codebase, primarily in C# and dealing with pretty much everything under ASP.NET umbrella. The usual routine being just finding bugs based on customer tickets and fixing them, or escalating it up to production and working with them. Or just investigating performance issues.

It's pretty much just pushing out bug fixes and maintaining a large legacy codebase. (and very rarely, implementing minor features) or just picking up the bits and pieces the main production team can't be bothered to do since they're working on the latest shiny thing.

It can get interesting at times just due to the fact that I get to dig into the code and investigating some real obscure bugs but like, I don't build anything, not even adding a single textbox or button.

Would you take a cut to weekly hours in lieu of a raise?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nwpoie/would_you_take_a_cut_to_weekly_hours_in_lieu_of_a/,[],1.0,1623365881.0,"(Throwaway account because relevant to my company right now)

So my non-tech company has been tip-toeing the line in regards to what our future WFH policy should be. We've been full-time remote since March 2020, with a plan to phase back into the office this summer/fall. The current plan is to offer 2-3 days of WFH with the other days being in the office.

Now, like many developers, the developers in our department want the ability to be full-time remote. On top of that, we are in a low-medium COL area so if we're not offered full-time remote as a benefit, the option to find a higher paying full-time remote job becomes way more lucrative. Money has been tight this past year. Haven't had any layoffs but a good chunk of employees didn't receive their annual merit raises.

I was wondering while thinking of my own ""solution"" to how to offer better benefits in lieu of money for developers, and the first thing that comes to mind would be working less hours per week (therefore technically a higher hourly rate, though we are salaried). I think being able to work <35 hours would be a great draw for some developers that want a better work-life balance compared to money (our salaries are competitive for the area, so that becomes moot if already in this area).

Would something like this attract you? Do you have any better ideas on what kind of benefits outside of money can be offered to developers? Would love to hear what you guys think!"

Especially if I've pulled an all-nighter the night before. I literally owe it to myself to catch up on some Z-z-z-z-s at any and all opportunities.

How to make sure I get PIP severance before leaving?,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nwb4eg/how_to_make_sure_i_get_pip_severance_before/,[],0.92,1623315504.0,"I at Big A, I can't transfer teams because I am on something called 'FOCUS' which they put you on before they PIP you.

Before my mental health leave I was throwing up before standup because of how nervous I was, so I really am dreading this return to work. I emailed my manager and HR and asked them to put me on PIP but they basically said some general HR speak like 'we can discuss when you get back, you can transfer teams you would just need to go through some additional steps'.

I was super excited, but after working for only 2 weeks, I already hate it.

1 They are behind on ALL their projects, yet the sales department keeps signing new projects. We currently have more active projects than people that work at the company.

2 I am the only person with ANY comp sci or software background. The employees are mechanical engineers and don’t know the difference between a float or an int. (I’m serious, a guy told me he had been debugging his program for hours and he had int x = .5 in the first 5 lines. Told me I was a “genius” for figuring it out so quickly.)

3 For my first project, they expect me to be some sort of wizard and fix some broken c++ computer vision code written by an intern over a year ago who no longer works at the company. The code is over 8,000 lines long and is split into less than 5 functions. (They are over a year late on delivering with this particular project.) Even if I do fix it, the sensors they have suck and will never be more than ~80% reliable, but I know I will still be the one to blame when the customer is unhappy with the result. I told them this during the last meeting and was told “we hired you to fix it”. 😑

How do I leave this job without leaving a permanent black mark on my record? This company has less than 20 people and they spent a bunch of money getting me a desk and new monitors. I fell bad for not giving it at least a few months, but at the same time this company is fundamentally broken and completely mismanaged. The thought of even working here another year makes me wanna cry. It’s not even a startup. The company has been in business since the late 80s.

If nothing else, I just want to vent. I got my comp sci degree to be a problem solver. I know I was a gifted programmer during school. I was always the “go to” guy among my comp sci classmates when they needed help. Now I feel like I am just wasting my talent and my education.

I have been working as a software engineer working predominantly with Python from last 2 years 4 months. 

The thing is when I joined my current employer, I right away started working with the Machine Learning Team. I used to help them in text processing tasks, sometimes Image processing which I learnt on the fly as it was not my forte. Later, I was full time handling the dialogue manager of a chatbot which is mainly purely python work, I have created several micro-services using Flask and FastAPI for our projects (ML included). 

I would say I am intermediate in Python + Flask and FastAPI, I understand Data Structures and I can write a decent code (though I want to advance here as well). BUT, the problem is I want to leave the ML team and switch to a full time Core Python Engineer job where I can work more with Python Projects, Teams and Grow in my career. Here, It is just ML related stuff, which, as I told is not my cup of tea.

Here's what I have researched so far, I should learn Django (I already done a basic course), Enhance my Python Skills, Update knowledge about Databases. The issue is I am not sure if what I am doing is correct or not. I would like to ask your suggestions on what can I do further to advance my career in Python, maybe learn about UI as well down the line.

I am really out of Ideas and the team I work with is small and they don't know much about Python so they can't advice me. I'm kind off hitting walls so someone on the web suggested posting here.

This will be my first full-time job after college, I have done internship in a pretty huge company for 6months. But I am confused which startup to select! Should I go for more money & helping lead designers or should I go for a flexible team where I am the lead but less pay. Please help."

I just don't know where to start, many of the High School pre-reqs are classes I never took / did bad in and I don't qualify. Any Canadians know where to point me towards?

Job offer - Background Check - Recruiter won't get back to me,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nwrkx5/job_offer_background_check_recruiter_wont_get/,[],1.0,1623370611.0,"I got a conditional job offer (gov contractor) about a month ago. It was conditional so I have to pass a background check. I passed my drug test. 1 month in and the company (CISIVE) that is doing the bg-check still have 1 item remaining for the last 2 or 3 weeks. I wrote to the recruiter once, I called too (directed to voicemail) and then I leaved a message, Recruiter won't respond to my email (I send it like 1 week ago). Since there is an offer involved, and the background check is still pending (at least that is what I can see from the CISIVE dashboard) and the recruiter won't get back to me, does this means that this fell through? I'm entitled to get my results from the background check? I have a clean record, no issues of anything whatsoever, good employment records, all in good shape. What gets my attention is the apparent long time this is taking (I have lived in 3 states here in U.S) and the recruiter don't reply. Is this normal practice from recruitment? Also the background check company won't disclose any information, they say the employer requested to not disclose anything with me, that I have to talk to the employer, but the recruiter which is the only person I've  been in contact with (apart from the dpt manager I interviewed with) won't reply. it feels like a waste of my time, if the job is not finally to me why they won't communicate this right away?

Also, a similar thing happened at the beginning after my interview, I wrote to them  asking if I got a 2nd interview, etc. The recruiter replied like 1 week later that they selected another person. Which is fine. Before the email I called like 2 or 3 times and always got a hang up. Then, suddenly like 10 days after that the recruiter called me that I'm the one (I suppose the first person didn't pass a drug test of something, etc.). Then the recruiter was suddenly 'very available' to me.

Now, I don't feel like all people should get my calls right away, but I do expect some level of professionalism."

Should I leave my new contract position a month in?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nwojao/should_i_leave_my_new_contract_position_a_month_in/,[],1.0,1623362905.0,"I am a Front End Dev with \~2 years of experience. I have recently left a full-time position (that I was unhappy with) to take on a contract with a company that I was really excited to work with as they have a lot of great brands under them, which also was a significant pay bump.

Upon being hired I was to do a simple React take-home challenge. Then I had a technical interview with JS, TS, and React/Redux questions. Now I am feeling as though the job is more difficult than anticipated. 

More importantly, there are a few issues that have come up so far that have started me off with bad vibes.

Before I even started, I was told there was a mac waiting for me as requested. I am far more productive in that environment and have productivity apps I utilize. 2 weeks before I am told by that they do not give out macs to new hires anymore and they’ll be sending a Dell, but I can use my own personal Mac if I have one.

On my first day, I am given an email about the required training/s to jump into. Two of them involve Drupal. Drupal was never in the job description or really discussed in the interview. I am later assured there is no PHP however Drupal is needed to be known as a CMS for client configurations. I do not particularly want to work with Drupal as I have experience working with WordPress before.

The onboarding has been my main problem. Day 1 they expect you to have code out, they say in the email it must all be completed within 10 days. There have been SO many access issues that I am blocked at each part of the initial setup even to be able to get to the coding portion. I spoke to a teammate who just went through the onboarding who is a Senior and he advised it took him about 20+ days to complete. Also, it is required to complete the onboarding before you're allowed to touch real code.

The onboarding doc is out of date at some parts and can be misleading. It seems as though they intentionally would like for you to struggle at some parts. It is over 200+ pages to go through, with additional links, along with fake code PRs to create as you go. I appreciated that they did provide training and they provide you a mentor to get through this training. However, the mentor can’t always help and I am often referred to public slack channels to ask for help.

I felt as though I should leave within the first week honestly. After my health started to take a toll and I lost my appetite over some of this stress in the decision I made. My gut has been telling me to leave and that I am seeing red flags already and it’s not worth it to waste their time or mine. Side note - I have enough savings to get by for a while along with being on my partner's health insurance.

I called the recruiter I was working with and let her know what I decided on.

They didn’t really take no for an answer I got many calls that day to convince me not to leave, to give it another shot, and was told that the onboarding was not quite like the job and it didn’t involve that much Drupal, it will get better after you get through the onboarding, etc... It was particularly pushy tbh but they wanted to assure me how excited the company is to have me and wants me there and to make sure that I do not have a bad experience.

Meanwhile, I did not even meet my direct manager within my first week. Not until I voiced my concerns with the onboarding, then I am set up a few meetings explaining my issues with it to other Senior devs. I felt so much pressure but ultimately I was convinced to give it more of a chance since they heard me out and it felt like all of a sudden it was a more supportive environment. The recruiter and my mentor (who doesn't even work on my team) have been supportive but also are telling me that the onboarding is nothing like the role, however, the Senior who created the onboarding said that it is pretty much exactly like the role and to prepare me for it. So I am also hearing a bit of a different story depending on who I speak with.

Personally, I would have preferred someone to pair with me on the more complex setup. Or some time to adjust to a new role and not thrown into intense training immediately. I never had a break between my previous job and this one. I feel like I can’t get that as they want you to struggle through the onboarding to learn the system.

I had issues even initially accessing anything and had to call the IT help desk, I wasn’t able to submit a time card, and had overall many access issues throughout the first 5 days or so.

I will say there are some nice things about the company so it's not ALL negative. Some things just don't really have me that excited anymore as far as the rules and regulations working with an enterprise-level system, and the slight lack of culture/fun. Not to mention I am not a huge fan of all the logging of hours on every task you do, but I anticipated that when taking on the contract of course.

&#x200B;

TLDR;

&#x200B;

I took a new contracting job. I am hearing two different stories on how much the role entails a skill they didn’t mention. Onboarding training has been a nightmare and you must complete it to do the real work. The recruiting company is coercing me to stay and give it more of a chance. I have wanted to leave within the first week due to lack of support, access issues, and overall gut feelings that I will be unhappy. Trying to consider if it is worth giving it more of a shot.

Is it fair to give this more of a chance or to cut ties and leave this off of my resume? I have been feeling pretty down and stressed over this all. I do not have a history of leaving jobs early and I do not know if I should follow my gut or really give this more time. Part of me feels the life's short, find the job you really love but I want to make sure that I am being reasonable."

I apologize if I jump around all over the place as I have been considering writing this up for some time now so I am basically unloading..  Anyways, I graduated with a bachelors in CS end of 2020.  After 3 months I got hired by a pretty well known consulting firm as a software engineer (remote for now), name starts with a T.  Usually at this firm every new hire goes through an initial learning program (usually 4 weeks java and some go through an additional 5 weeks of full stack).  Maybe because I already had this experience I was not put into this program but got assigned straight to an account/client whereas everyone else had to go through account interviews and had some say on what project or tech stack they wanted to work on.  


Anyways, I got assigned to an account automatically.  Its been 3 months going on 4 (started march 1st).  I went through about a month of onboarding for the company and the client company which heavily emphasized agile development, scrum.  Throughout this time the project manager was telling me how I would be developing a little bit but mostly I would be fulfilling their business analyst role for the account project.  This seemed off to me so I had multiple talks trying to reconfirm this as I expected a software engineering (junior dev) role but he kept telling me that everyone on the account has to go through business analysis training so that everyone is on the same page...  Anyways after the first month (onboarding), I went through about 5 weeks of developer training on an ITSM cloud platform called ServiceNow along with some random courses on ITIL and Business Analysis but most of the training was ServiceNow development.  This dev training left me very, unfulfilled?  There was barely any programming, just a small amount of scripts in JS.  I guess I am too used to the programming assignments that I went through at university in C++, Java, and C#.    


After that 5 weeks (about 9-10 weeks since I started) I was told that I would start shadowing one of the senior devs who I would be helping with an integration project from ServiceNow to SAP.  At this point another thing that caught me off guard was a team meeting where on a document everyones roles were listed.  Next to my name was business analyst...  I talked to the project manager again and he said it was a typo and emailed me an updated file that said junior dev...  I guess at this point I should also say, for the first two months I was “allocated” to the project already but it wouldn't show up in the system so I couldn't see it or the role I was assigned.  It took two and a half months, to get allocated while being told: “HR says you were just allocated so give it a day or two to update” and it wouldn't update, then I would go and inform project manager again, he would say he contacted HR and that it would happen shortly.  This happened close to 10 times until I finally saw it in the system.

  
Anyways, a day or two after that the senior dev got covid and went on 2 week leave.  During this time I basically had nothing to do.  I asked several times if there was stuff I could work on and the project manager assigned me random courses on servicenow machine learning and performance analytics (never dabbled in machine learning or ai before).  I got these done in about 2 days and afterwards I was told that I could just look at side courses or self learn until the senior dev came back.  I decided to review my old course notes at university and stuff regarding data structures and algorithms.  Did that for about a week and the last 2-3 days before the senior dev came back, I'll admit, I goofed off a bit... 

     
Now, senior dev came back from leave around 03-24-21.  She had a lot on her plate, I'll admit, and told me that we would be starting the integration project shortly and told me to brush up on some stuff regarding integrations with servicenow.  Did a small lab assigned by her that week and awaited more details and or work from her but she was busy the entire week so I decided to try to self learn again.  Now for the last week and half I have been getting small half hour tasks every day or two that honestly anybody can do.  I have literally only written one line of code since mid may while being told that the integration project will be starting shortly up until today.  During this free time I have been trying to keep myself busy, learn python, and just self learn in general but this is driving me nuts.  I was barely getting any development experience with this platform (ServiceNow) and for the last 3 weeks it feels like I have done nothing besides go into the system and change up some text for some labels.

   
I am considering talking to the group in the consulting firm that handles the allocation of associates to accounts but have been informed in the initial onboarding during the first month that you cannot get off an account or switch accounts in the middle of a project without it negatively affecting the associates internal resume.  On top of that, apparently this project I have been assigned to has been in the works for 3+ years and they still expect another 2+ years (according to the senior dev I am shadowing).  Some people I know in the industry recommend that I should stop complaining and stick it out at this company as I am still getting paid, decently, for my first job post graduation without much work/effort but I feel like I am stagnating...  On one hand it would look bad if I were to try to job hope only 3-4 months into my first job but then it would also look bad (imo) if I work here for a year or two and barely get any programming experience...

They've also shown a really great attitude, interest, and trust in me, so I feel like it's my duty to be as prepared as possible. Since it's a startup, things also move very fast so I don't have a lot of time to get really good at the tech stack (I find that taking on unique and challenging projects facilitates my learning much better and faster than just watching a tutorial that tells me how to write a for loop and copy-pasta).

I know I'm capable and confident as a developer, but not so much at this role. What are your thoughts, suggestions, and experiences?"

Demoted when applying,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nwkbll/demoted_when_applying/,[],1.0,1623349986.0,"Initially on my 6th year in the industry I was promoted as a Associated Lead Dev on a multinational company somewhere in Southeast Asia (well you can see where base on my profile but let's keep it vague).

But then it was when I was trying to find a job abroad, so I only taken the role for 3 months and on one project as I was hired in New Zealand as Senior Dev (was applying on that level before getting the promotion).

Now here in NZ after 2 years, I am currently trying to look for my next job for personal reason. 

So far I got some few application on going and somewhere I failed.

But one evaluated me on my technical interview as a strong or high intermediate but not quite senior.

Noting as my previous role are mostly on under a consulting company. And I didn't explain the SOLID  principle enough during the interview. They do note that I write good code base on the assignment they gave.

Now, I really like the company and was hoping to get hired. Tomorrow I got a manager interview but not for a senior on which I applied but on intermediate role now.

I feel conflicted continuing, but I said to just go with it and check until the offer.

I still got two other application ongoing for senior role.

The one failed was because the role was fully remote and I didn't articulate much and my answer was shallow and need a follow up. They see it as a problem on remote setup but if on an office setup they might let it pass. So more on communication, that was on technical interview.

I guess I mostly writing my thought here and my feelings on keep getting evaluated one level down."

Would you quit if you were lied to during salary negotiation?,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvu8q0/would_you_quit_if_you_were_lied_to_during_salary/,[],0.96,1623269195.0,"I've just accepted a new contracting position for a fortune 500 company. I am employed W-2 through a contracting agency who offers some benefits the Big Corp doesn't pay like vacation time and sick days. I was told that the agency would be paying me for any holidays Big Corp followed, and in addition I would be paid a floating holiday that I could use at any time like PTO. During salary negotiation when I learned of a time-off benefit that wasn't very good (for example, only one sick day), I increased my target rate accordingly so that I could take some additional days off unpaid and still meet my target rate. They accepted my rate, and I signed paperwork. I first signed the employment contract that detailed my rate, but didn't mention any other benefits as they said it would all be coming later. Paperwork granting me sick days and PTO eventually trickled in, but I never got any paperwork for holidays. At this point I had forgotten about it since I had already started work.

Memorial Day just passed and I wasn't paid for those hours, and now I'm being told that I misunderstood and holidays were always unpaid. I know what I heard. So not being paid for 11 holidays is effectively a 4.2% cut which I feel is pretty significant. Not only that, but I was told that if Big Corp doesn't meet their quarterly goals then contractors won't be paid for the days before and after holidays as well, and while that didn't apply to me this quarter, there are no guarantees. For example if this happened at the end of the year I would lose out on a week of wages for Christmas and New Year's. In the worst case that could add 20 additional unpaid days to the year. That's potentially an additional 7.6% cut although my boss says this rarely happens. None of this is mentioned in the paperwork I signed.

My problem is really my compensation, if they had told me this before accepting the job and agreed to pay me a higher rate accordingly then I would be fairly happy right now. But 4.2% is more than the annual raise I had gotten from my last two jobs put together so I'm pretty disappointed.

Mine didn’t look like that. They handed me some tutorials and basic personal projects, then put me on client work (at the last minute too, so perhaps it was all poor planning). These weren’t easy bugfixes either- I was building most of our API in a language I’ve never used. I did learn a lot, but it had a crazy short turnaround time and a small team. I felt extremely anxious the entire time. Told this to some peers near the end, that I’d like more guidance or wished my job started with even a few days of shadowing or someone showing my the ropes, but those concerns were brushed aside as imposter syndrome, that I’d get over it. But I don’t feel “imposter syndrome” way, more “too much is being asked of me, I’m using too many tools that I don’t understand, and no one has really shown me how we do things at this workplace.”

My new project is using another framework I don’t know, adding on to an app I don’t understand. Was really excited to try a fresh start, maybe taking easy tickets like I expected on the first one. But I’m lost in the codebase, everything’s too abstracted for me to follow the logic flow. Plus I’m getting constant errors trying to run it, with not a ton of help, and I’m on an even smaller team. The client expects a decent chunk of functionality done by the end of next week.

Someone please tell me this gets better, or that other jobs give me a tiny bit of guidance or something. Or give me tips on how to understand what I’m doing on my own, or even to just stress less about this junior dev job."

Premed Junior wanting to switch to become a SWE in Big Tech.

I just wanted to start out by saying thank you for taking the time to read this post and helping some internet stranger find his path. I greatly appreciate any and all feedback, especially from people already in the industry or people with a similar story to mine. You guys are awesome!

&#x200B;

For some backstory, I currently am a Junior majoring in Biology at the University of Washington in Seattle. I currently have finished out almost all of the backbone classes I need for my degree and mostly just have biology electives left. This whole time, I've had my sights set on becoming a physician (probably Emergency Medicine), but I feel like the more I think about it, the less and less appealing it seems like the life of a physician would be for me. While I believe I am a very competitive student for getting into med school, I don't like the idea of working 50+ hours a week. I want to make sure I have time in the future to enjoy my outside interests and spend time with my future family. I also was heavily influenced by how lucrative the field is, but factoring in opportunity cost and debt, I truthfully just don't think all the stress of medical school, residency, and even physician life is worth it to me. While I'm still interested in biology and medicine and have largely enjoyed my studies, I just can see that my own passion isn't on par with most of the other premeds around me that have wanted to be doctors since they were three years old and want nothing more. While it's been a long time coming, over the past several days, I think I've finally decided I'm done and want something else with my life. 

&#x200B;

While it hurts to consider that the last three years of my education might have been a sunk cost, it's allowed me to be more honest with myself that becoming a software engineer might be my real calling in life. Ever since I was a kid, computers and tech have always been incredibly fascinating to me. Through Roblox, I learned Lua when I was in middle school and got really good at making fun little games that my friends and I could play together and with others. In the years since, I've also developed more advanced games that involve pulling real-time data from stock market APIs, creating complex GUIs, and using Perlin noise to build essentially an amateur Minecraft knock-off. I feel like I've got to a similar level of competency with Python where I can write scripts for web scraping and automation through Selenium (I wrote one program to automatically do my ochem homework, another for sniping GPUs for me and my friends as soon as they go on sale), as well as simulate things like the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem), and making Discord bots as a freelance side gig. For me, I absolutely love the process of coming up with an idea for a new project, beginning to piece it out, writing code, fixing chunks of code when they inevitably don't work the first time, and then fixing other bugs and fleshing out new features to add and the challenge of implementing them in without breaking anything in the process. I love that sort of workflow and I think I would greatly enjoy doing that and actually paid a good salary for my work.

&#x200B;

I guess the actual problem I have at this point is that having made my decision to pursue this path instead, I don't know what my next move should be. While I know the fundamentals of Python quite well, I still have no idea how to use things like GitHub and I've barely touched other programming languages, much less have a full portfolio of React apps to show off for any sort of interview. I feel like my skills have started to plateau at this point and think that in order to get any further, a formal CS education or boot camp would have to be my next move. I've ultimately thought of four potential options I can take in order to further my learning and move closer to starting a career in the field and would greatly appreciate your help in deciding what is the wisest decision for me in order to crack into the industry.

&#x200B;

**Option 1: Finish my BS in biology and go to a boot camp.** 

This sounds like a reasonable option for me, but I've heard very conflicting things about these boot camps, especially in recent years. Some have said boot camps are more than enough to get people who had never written a line of code prior into FAANG+ company jobs, whereas others say they are absolute garbage and I'd be better off lighting my money on fire. While I'm sure that for most, the truth is somewhere between the two, I definitely still have some reservations. I'm worried that they would greatly limit my job prospects in the short term not having any sort of real certification, as well as potentially limiting me in the long term if I'm missing some of the fundamental knowledge I need for working in more lucrative positions or at big tech companies. However, if this is a viable option, the appeal of not spending an extra 2-3 years in school to get a degree in CS would be a huge advantage.

&#x200B;

**Option 2: Finish my BS in biology and then get a MS in Computer Science.**

I think this would be a viable option as it ultimately would not take significantly longer, but I could still get a masters which I assume would be good for getting my foot in the door for higher up positions. However, I do recognize that in this case, I still have a lot of work to do completing prereqs and actually getting my coding knowledge to the level that I would actually have a shot in something akin to the notorious Google interview. I also don't know if having a BS in Bio + a MS in CS is significantly/at all better for job prospects than a BS in Bio + a BS in CS, bringing me to the next option:

&#x200B;

**Option 3: Do a double major in Biology and in CS.**

This seems like possibly the most reasonable option. I think this opens more doors for me as I still am a little more distinguished having a secondary degree, but still am fully qualified for entry-level CS jobs (again assuming I take side projects and internships seriously during this time, etc.). This also would just somewhat emotionally/mentally make me feel better as I would still get my Biology degree that I've worked this hard for and wouldn't feel like it was a total waste. However, if the biology degree really would make next to no difference in most positions, I would rather save the extra year it takes to get, bringing me to my final potential choice:

&#x200B;

**Option 4: Switch my major to CS and quit Biology.**

If my biology degree really is unnecessary, I'd really rather not waste the extra year it would take, the tuition money that I could save, and the opportunity cost of starting my career a year later. I just want to make sure doing something like that wouldn't be premature or closing too many doors, even considering I'm not really interested in going into bioinformatics or similar fields. 

&#x200B;

If any of you out there reading this have some insight you would be willing to share, I would find that unbelievable valuable and I just want to express I am very grateful. I'm definitely still struggling to come to terms that going into medicine isn't for me, but I'm cautiously optimistic about this new direction. Once again, thank you all!

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I'm a junior in college at UW in Seattle. I wanted to be a doctor but decided it's not the right fit for me. I taught myself the basics of Lua and Python as a kid, got better over time, and now I've decided I wanna be a Software Engineer as a career. I don't know if I should finish my biology degree and do a boot camp, switch to a CS degree, do a double major, or finish my degree and get a masters in CS."

New Career + Massive Responsibility == One Burnt Out Dude. Thoughts on where to go next?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nwe8iy/new_career_massive_responsibility_one_burnt_out/,[],1.0,1623325532.0,"Throwaway account for this one - I'll have to keep the details sparse as to keep future me out of trouble.

I've read a bunch of posts about people being tired. Burnt out. This is kind of that, but also me coming to the kind folks of reddit asking for thoughts on a decision I need to make.

Here's where I'm at: I've been some type of engineer for the past 4 years. Once COVID hit, the sector I was working in as a mechanical engineer took at dive and I was laid off. I was unemployed for about 9 months. During that time I coded up and launched a completely ill-advised micro-saas product that taught me how hard it is to market a product no one needs. It was good fun, though, and I learned a bunch of coding skills.

Once the money dried up, it felt like a natural direction to seek work in software engineering. I put together a portfolio and was invited to join a growing startup.

I was hired with the understanding that I'd be doing pretty basic dev work. Because I'm a rabid learner, people pleaser, and have zero boundaries, I found myself (within a few months) being solely  responsible for scaling the backend to handle enormous amounts of traffic. I ended up learning enough cloud tech to pull it off, but my lack of experience caused the whole thing to be quite stressful.

I followed best practices according to my research, but I felt that I shouldered lot of responsibility for someone with no previous professional tech experience. I live with daily anxiety that this overhauled backend will break in some mysterious way and I will be the only person with a chance at fixing it. I leveraged this added responsibility for a sizeable raise and a fancy title (as one does).

Recently, the company hired a couple more engineers to do the thing I was doing (backend cloud stuff) and I have pretty much been managing that team. They have way more experience than I do. I appreciate the help and I've tried to learn as much as I can from them, but I'm still pretty responsible for the success or failure we have going forward.

This might sound super out of touch, but I've found this whole entrance into the tech world has been a bit of a turn off. It might sound like things are all rosy and I've been incredibly lucky to have had this opportunity and ability to pull this stuff off but I'm *so very* fried. I'm at the end of a long vacation and I dread going back. It's anxiety all day long. Offered $500k/year I probably still wouldn't want this responsibility for much longer.

I feel like I'm at a dead end. The work has just become too stressful (mostly because I'm constantly making high-impact decisions with little experience) and too off in the weeds in terms of interest. I'm not in love with cloud architecture work. It's cool stuff and I've learned a ton, but it's not something I'm passionate about. I'm passionate about making things that are useful to users. That's why I turned to software in the first place. That's why I made my $0 MRR app and loved every minute of it.

Here are a few paths that I'm considering going down. I'm at about 1 year's worth of saved living expenses.

1. Quit and focus full time on market research for a more viable micro-saas venture. It's become a dream of mine to create something (however small) of value that I can offer directly.
2. Stick it out until I have a couple year's worth of savings and do # 1. That would be another 6 or  so months.
3. Work my way 'down' the org chart to get back to more general dev work and see how that feels.

I know re-hireability is a big concern for many when considering drastic career moves. I'm not as worried about that as I'm honestly not sure about working in software engineering (as part of a company) as a viable path forward in the long run.  Maybe I should be more concerned, but I'm not at the moment.

Anyone else have a similar experience? Premature heavy responsibility, lack of mentorship, the call of the open road (career-wise or literal)?

I'm coming to the hivemind for a brainstorm. I'm sure there are options here I'm not considering. It's hard to see the forest for the trees when stuff gets overwhelming. Happy to answer any questions.

Thanks in advance."

I graduated from college with an environmental related degree \~5 months ago and have been self-teaching code (avg \~15 hours/week for 4 months - or 25 hours/week if you include time wasted reading about 'life as a developer' and random blog posts/videos relevant to the lifestyle of web devs/related roles) and working part-time in a barely relevant job, just realizing there's not a huge amount of marketability to my degree since it's pretty general exposure to Ecology/Biology/Biostatistics/Writing.

The job market for self-taught web developers seems to be really oversaturated, thus why I have been looking into apprenticeships / programs such as Revature. As mentioned, I've been self learning through Udemy with Colt Steele's 2020 Web Developer Bootcamp, which is \~60% finished, combined with FreeCodeCamp's curriculum to cement syntax practice and Eloquent JavaScript reading to help with theory more.

"Have serious issues with the culture in this industry.

I also have experience working in a couple other industries and know this is not happening everywhere in ""professional"" full time jobs.

Basically, I like programming and coding. However, I do not like the personalities that seem to exist across this industry.

It feels like many people in this industry, especially ones who get into some positions of power (senior dev, leads, etc..), are just plain anti-social.

I watch how they treat new hires for example. They basically just hand them stories with little to no context and then act all ""high and mighty"" when the new hire dares asks questions, acting like there questions are so obvious (when, no, they are not. Especially to a new hire). 

If you try to talk about anything with them, its almost painful to have a conversation with them. In other industries, you can ask questions or have small conversations about work related items (like, if you had a passing curiosity in something) and get answers or have a light hearted conversations about things. However, here, I literally have watched someone mention if someone is heading out for the day, and the response is a flat 5 word response ""what do you need"" (not, yep I'm heading out or some other pleasantry that anyone with half a personality could say), when it would be obvious to anyone with how the question was said that they were just curious and trying to say bye. Its a small thing, but there is just a bunch of these small things

Basically, it just feels like in this industry, if you don't have some boring personality and at the same time don't know all the answers to most things, you are just shunned by those with these anti-social traits. I realize this is not everyone by the way. Also, that phrasing may not be perfectly saying what I am attempting to describe.

But, it just feels like a good chunk of this industry and anti-social, makes a LOT of assumptions about what others are saying without just trying to get clarification or being human, and overall it just feels like a lot just have anti-personality issues.

Again, I like coding. But I am just tired of this culture in this industry and wish there were at least more people with even a basic level of social skills while not being a bunch of a-holes.

PS: Before anyone starts mentioning people being ""on the spectrum"" as being part of the problem. I'm sorry, but I disagree. I bring this up because I hear that a lot.

"Landed job at tiny software company as ""lead dev"" (i.e only dev), but I lack fundamental knowledge.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nw0ps0/landed_job_at_tiny_software_company_as_lead_dev/,[],0.92,1623286828.0,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions, 

This got way longer than I wanted. It's basically a rant/therapy post, but I'd love to hear advice or any similar experiences. 

Some background about me: I did my bachelors & masters in a techy-arts program, during which I got decently impressive work experience in various tech-ish jobs. 3 years ago I switched gears to learn more about the software development side of my field (mostly C++), so I took a few coding classes and landed an unpaid internship at a company doing exactly that. I was totally lost when I started, but I studied pretty hard and learned a decent amount working with Anila (the only developer at the company). I also contributed some pretty useful code which still generates profit. I left a year later to focus on my classes. 

Fast forward to today, recently graduated, and found out Anila was leaving the company. I interviewed and got the job as her replacement. It's pretty clear to me that my unpaid internship was the main factor in my acceptance, because they already have experience with me. 

Anila (super nice person) already started their new job, but is staying on with the company about an hour a day to help with the transition, so I'm trying to learn all the ins & outs. This position is full-stack - from answering support emails, writing new products, bug fixing, communicating with testing team, etc. Pretty intense high stakes stuff. 

So I'm feeling uneasy. I did not go to CS school, I only took some classes. I'm self-taught via youtube tutorials, but I completely lack fundamental C++ knowledge. If I had to do an entry-level coding interview test (never tried) I have no doubt I would fail it. I've designed fairly impressive field-specific C++ software by banging my head against a wall and googling all my problems - but if I were asked to define what a ""class"" is off the top of my head, I would struggle. THAT SAID, they couldn't hire any old software dev - I have some pretty specific experience in this artsy field. So I do have a good grasp on the ""big picture"" of the company if that makes sense. 

But here I am, in charge of everything all of a sudden. It's terrifying to think of when Anila will no longer have time to help out, because despite me being full time, they do 90% of the work. 

I do also suffer from depression and intense self-criticism (read: imposter syndrome). So my own judgement is flawed. But when I try to look at it objectively without self-pity, my knowledge of fundamentals is still concerning. The good news is that they've been understanding so far. I asked for feedback and they only had positive things to say. So I'm not acutely worried about being fired, but I feel like they're going to ""discover me"" once Anila leaves and I'm unable to put out fires. 

I'll wrap this up - if this resonates with you, if you recognize yourself in this post, I'd love to hear from you and get advice, C++ textbook recommendations, or even just commiseration!"

Company B: Waiting for final round interview to be scheduled, working with a recruiter. Process has been going very well so far, I'm very optimistic about my chance for an offer. They are fully aware of the pending offer from company A and are genuinely trying to move the process along as quickly as possible, but are only able to guarantee a full wrap-up time of next Wednesday.


What should I tell Company A? Should I be honest and tell them I have another opportunity I'm waiting to hear back on? I think giving me 5 days is already fairly generous so I'm loathe to ask them to extend it further. My current thought was to simply be honest, but also make it clear that:

1. I'm already happy with their offer in terms of compensation, and I'm not going to be using any secondary offer as negotiation leverage.
2. The other opportunity is in a different industry and not a competitor in any sense.
3. Add that I've told company B of a pending offer and B asked if they could hurry along the process as much as possible - and I felt rude to refuse.

I do have a question of when to ask for the extension. Should I do it tomorrow ASAP? Or wait until Monday? I have the feeling I should let them know ASAP. Any other thoughts?

Leetcode question practice or develop a portfolio first,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nw9nsn/leetcode_question_practice_or_develop_a_portfolio/,[],1.0,1623311010.0,"Hi guys,

I was hoping for mentor like guide on how I can break into the industry as a prospective career. I graduated in computer science so I know all the fundamentals like data structures, algorithms, databases, etc. I learned these concepts rigorously and attained good grades for. however, where i was a little more deceitful in my undergrad was for project work like making a website that incorporated these concepts. For most big project work, I took help from friends more since they were mostly group tasks and i usually contributed more in the presentation/writing aspect of things and coordinating the work. Overall though, I managed to graduate with a high GPA but still highly lacking in confidence of applying the concepts i learned into actual projects.

Its been about four years since I graduated, in this time I never worked in the industry and instead did non-technical teaching jobs and assisted family in some personal issues. More importantly I was in a relationship that went sour and the experience left me feeling very depressed for a long time. Now I'm at a point where I feel that maybe I should give another shot at trying to get in the industry, since I already have the fundamental understandings.

My question is, how would you advise me in proceeding from here, based on this? Ive spent the past week trying to solve [cses.fi](https://cses.fi) questions and completed most of the introductory problems. I'm not the best at coding due to my lack of practice and i would be considered a beginner by all metrics. But I'd say i can get decent if I stay persistent for the next two months with cses and leetcode. Should I continue doing this until I solve around 100 questions? Or should my priority be in learning some frameworks like django for python web development to build some portfolio projects following courses like the ones on udemy?

Or would it be easier if i instead went in the direction of becoming a data analyst / AI engineer since from what I can understand, that involves less framework development and perhaps more suited and easier to master from my current status?

Or, would it be more beneficial if I ditch the developer/engineer role from the start and focus more on a business analyst / project manager role by doing the relevant degrees (PMP)? I think ideally this would be my goal regardless, but I figured that having the experience in a technical background is crucial for future success as a manager. I am always at a loss for words when I have to answer what I am good at, but my friends have generally commented that my presentation and communication skills are very good and I am more suited to work in a career where I can utilize that.

Finally, I've mentioned all these options because right now I'm kind of starting fresh and open to going in any direction. I am looking at a 4 to 6 month time frame to catch up to speed and secure a job. I have a lot to cover for in lost time, and I would really appreciate if any altruist would look at me as their younger brother and share some advice on how I should proceed forward, if they were in my shoes. Thanks In Advance!

TL;DR: CS grad without much experience in doing projects, and never entered the industry since graduating 4 years ago, but trying to make a comeback. I understand all core CS concepts, beginner programmer, good presentation/communication skills. Should I practice cses,fi problems to build up programming skills first, or dive into making portfolio projects using frameworks following online courses like udemy? or skip developer roles and prepare for data analyst / AI ? Or go into Business Analyst or Project Manager roles from the start? TIA"

I recently found out that I made it past the hiring committee at Google for a job as a new grad software engineer. I am now in the team matching phase, and luckily it seems like there is some interest in me from teams already.

So I will be meeting with teams to see if I am a good fit for them and they are a good fit for me, but the problem is that I don't have industry experience (no internships) and I'm unsure what would be the best things to ask a potential team about. 

I'm sure I could come up with plenty of things off the top of my head, such as what product they work on, what languages they use, what tools they employ, what the work-life balance is like, but I don't think the scope of my questions would be complete because of my lack of industry experience. I'm hoping that some people with job experience working on a software dev team in a big company like this can offer me some good suggestions, both on things I should consider and things I should ask about. If you were interviewing with different teams for a good match, what would you ask?

For the record, I have worked before. I am in my mid twenties and have years of experience working in retail & finance, so I am not unfamiliar with workplaces in general, just unfamiliar with the finer details of working in my new career. I (will) have (soon) a CS degree from a prestigious university, so I have worked on smaller team software projects before also, for classes.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Edit: Oh, also. How does one negotiate with a company if they are your only offer? I can hope that they'll make me an offer that I will be happy with, but if it's below what is expected, do I have room to negotiate still? Or do you need another offer or past salary established to use as leverage?"

Career Advice: Path to machine learning/data engineer,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nwb15o/career_advice_path_to_machine_learningdata/,[],1.0,1623315216.0,"Hello all,

I am at a crossroads and need some advice. I am thinking of doing a data science boot camp which will land me a data analyst position or full stack boot camp and work as a web developer/software engineer. Regardless of which path I take, my plan is to obtain a master's in data science. My end goal is to be a machine learning engineer or data engineer with implementations in improving healthcare. I'm not really interested in the business aspect of things or doing presentations so I crossed ""data scientist"" off the list.

My background: B.S.(bullshit) degree in Molecular biology and 4 years working as an associate scientist in a biotech company. I took some time off to pursue other things and eventually went back to school to take multivariate calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, discrete math, and C++.

So my question is: do I go with the the data science boot camp and work as data analyst making 60-70k or go with a full stack boot camp and come out making 90-110k as a software engineer(I live in the sf bay area)? I plan to work for 2 years then apply for a data science master's program. I pretty much have 0 chance of landing a data scientist position with my background even though the boot camp covers a lot of data science/machine learning topics. The reason I'm leaning towards full stack is because a lot of the requirements for the machine learning/data engineer jobs I see mention extensive experience in software engineering and of course the higher pay. Also, I've heard that I would learn most the same things in the master's program as I would in the data science boot camp but it's also easier to self learn web development.

P.s. I'm already in the data science boot camp but can drop out early without taking much of a hit"

I say because it follows along with how the other naming conventions on the table are like foo_*****. He replies “we should change those too”. Now the lead dev chimes in saying yeah good point change that. And i’m like WTF!!! You looked at this, worked with it, refactored it for MONTHS. If he didn’t like it why is it on me NOW and i have to go through ALL the code to change it. Also lead dev and this guy have worked together before at another company and it kinda just feels like now that this issue has been raised, it has to get done because people can’t back down from their position.

Now that I've accepted, I am having second thoughts about being becoming a professor. The emphasis on grant-chasing and teaching really concerns me, since I really love the research but not much else about academia. 

I definitely want to give the faculty position a try before deciding on anything. 

I am very concerned about what my industry job prospects will look like in a few years. Right now, my technical skills are likely as strong as they will be, since I just read and write papers and code all day. In a few years, I would guess I will probably have more of a holistic view of the field (as well as additional publications), and I will also have a bit more management experience. But my coding skills will likely be weaker, and I expect that as a professor I will not have enough time to grind leetcode.

What would my options be in industry, after leaving the tenure track? Some of the people I know who have left faculty positions have ended up with ""director of research""-type titles etc at smaller companies. Would those sorts of management positions be the correct next step from a faculty position?

I'm a May 2020 grad who's 8 months into a SWE job. I have been remote, so I have never met any of my coworkers on either of the teams I have been on. I have had issues with work anxiety in the past (even though I have historically gotten praise at all my jobs); I am seeing a therapist for some of that currently. I was on a good team that I learned to mesh with (work anxiety comes with social anxiety) for the first seven months; I had biweekly 1-on-1s, I could reach out to people if I was having trouble, team was focused on everybody's growth. I became accustomed to them and the reality of pandemic work as a junior over those months and met some supportive people who made me feel welcomed along the way.

Now, on my new team, I haven't had a one-on-one, I don't really have anybody I can talk to about work stuff, and there seems to be more pressure to churn out tickets instead of on growing as an engineer. A hallmark of my work anxiety is that I worry constantly that I will be fired over something small (forgot to fix a unit test before committing, took too long to answer a message, ""why did it take you X number of days to finish a ticket when it took Y X/2 days?!""); having regular (or even semi-regular) interactions with team leads (it doesn't seem like this team has them in the same sense) helped assuage those fears, so I am going to be looking into where I should look for feedback and help on non-technical matters.

What I am looking for here is input from anybody on the following:

1. what did you do if you were in a situation where you needed mentorship but couldn't find it?
2. how do you know the difference between a bad fit and it being in your head?
3. how do you air your concerns without being whiny?

I do full-stack web development, so I've been involved in everything from designing and architecting applications to implementing new features to reviewing pull requests and everything in-between.

Seeking Advice For Adults Experiences Going Back To College,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nw4arq/seeking_advice_for_adults_experiences_going_back/,[],0.6,1623296116.0,"Hello all,

I have come seeking advice about going back to college for an undergrad CS degree. First I'll give a little bit of background. I am 33 years old with a wife and a child (2 years old). I graduated in 2012 with a BS in Geology and immediately went to work in the Oil & Gas Industry. It paid very well but was very strenuous. To be honest, I was miserable traveling away for 2 weeks at a time and working 24 hours per day (sleeping when I could but always on call). While I was working, I wanted to change into something else but with the demanding schedule and having poor internet connection, online courses just weren't feasible.

&#x200B;

That all came to a halt anyways in September after the oil market crashed due to covid and overproduction and I was laid off. I had saved up a decent amount and unemployment kept us a float. My wife is a stay at home mom. While looking at different options and finally writing off getting called back for my previous job,  I began looking into college for a BS in CS to eventually become a software developer. I've always had interest in computers my entire life and have dabbled into linux, coding with python, but nothing more than light exposure. 

&#x200B;

I started contacting several universities near me and am in the process to see everything that transfers but I am anticipating at least 2 years for core classes (I had Calc I & II for my first undergrad and all my GEC's should transfer). While I've been waiting, I have thrown myself into research and began practicing and following tutorials on youtube for coding in python to try to get ahead of the curve.

&#x200B;

Here is my dilemma, I'm not sure if it's a feasible option for me as I have a mortgage, family, etc that I need to provide for. I would be perfectly willing to find a full time job to pay bills and even if it's part time/not enough money, utilize savings and even 401k to stay a float. My wife has offered to try to get a job but she's unlikely to be able to make enough to cover the bills and childcare would eat into a lot of those earnings as well. Unfortunately all the colleges are going back away from their online courses and going back into class. To be honest, I'd probably do a lot better in class but that makes it difficult for a 8-5 pm M-F job with class. I also would be lying if I said I wasn't a bit nervous and stressed about the thought of going back to college (I know it will be different now being a way more responsible adult than I was my first go around) so if it got too difficult, I'd want to focus on school.

&#x200B;

So I guess my questions are:

1) What were your experiences going back as an adult with responsibilities such as a mortgage, family, etc? 

2) What kind of options were available to you? I know I could take out a personal loan for it school + living expenses and pay it off over the next decade. I don't think I'd qualify for many scholarships or grants as it would be a 2nd degree and it shows I made too much money for FAFSA while working.

3) What are your thoughts on potential coding bootcamps? This hasn't been something that has enticed me because while I know that you don't -technically- need to have a degree in tech, it will help you get looked at having a CS degree vs not. I also feel like I'd miss out on a lot of detail that you get from going to a university.

&#x200B;

Again, I appreciate any and all advice/experiences/etc given. It's been pretty stressful at times but I want to change my life for the better and I feel like there is no better time than to do it now. I'm just not quite sure how. To actually be home every night to see my son instead of being gone for weeks at a time while doing something I'll enjoy would be amazing."

Started out with some simple tasks/analysis  that I frequently needed help on, so I learned who to ask on the team and the right questions to ask. I progressed from there and was assigned little bigger things. 

Fast forward to now. I’m being given full features that take around a month to implement. I basically take the rough template, get the requirements clarified, work with my teammate and the business analyst to implement it, send it to production. I am at a point where I don’t need much supervision for tasks. 

someone can say: this is a feature we need and I can help them refine it, and implement it.

Does my job responsibility sound more like entry level or mid level?

How to deal with another dev who is controlling?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nw1tw3/how_to_deal_with_another_dev_who_is_controlling/,[],0.67,1623289705.0,"I'll keep this brief - 

I recently started a new job as a dev, and another person started at the same time as me. They can be controlling - trying to tell me what to do (even if I'm already doing it), trying to do the majority of our project (even if it means doing parts I'm already working on), etc. I've told them to stop trying to do work that overlaps with mine, but I wasn't as aggressive as maybe I needed to be. If anyone has dealt with a controlling coworker, do you have advice on any of these questions? It's very appreciated!

&#x200B;

1. How to respond to them when they try to tell you what to do? (Ex. ""OP, how about you work on X and I'll do Y?"" - it doesn't matter who does what, so I feel like it will be pointless to contest it (especially in front of the rest of the team), but they are definitely trying to steal what they deem to be the best task for themself)
2. How to respond when they do work that overlaps with yours? (I've approached them on this once, but maybe not aggressively enough)
3. How to respond when they try to one-up you in team discussions? (Ex. The coworker only piped up in the meeting to bring up the cons to a suggestion I made)

I am not a person who will let someone walk over them, but I also don't want to have to fight with this person or play mind games at work to try and fend them off. It seems difficult to approach someone on being controlling when a lot of it can be like a microagression (not a big show of being controlling, but little subtler things/comments over time). But I think if I don't start pushing back harder at these micro-shows of control, then this person will feel like they can manipulate me and keep doing it. There is also a difference in gender between us, and I definitely don't think that is the only factor, but in this field I can't rule it out as a reason.. not that the reason really matters. Any advice is welcome."
How legit are the calls from Indian consultancies offering contract or w2 positions in the US?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nw1huf/how_legit_are_the_calls_from_indian_consultancies/,[],0.5,1623288839.0,"The word 'Indian' just refers to the consultancies based mostly in India and calling to people in the US and not to all Indian population. I am an Indian myself and this post does not question the genuine consultancies.

So, I  just graduated in Computer Science and I am looking for a job in the US. I updated my LinkedIn profile to #OpenToWork and I already had my phone number posted in my resume on my profile. Immediately after doing that I received around 20+ calls in just 3 days of posting that. I removed my number and since then the calls have significantly reduced.

All the calls are from people working from India, claiming to be in the US with a US phone number flashing mostly from Texas and New Jersey. Some of them told me about this after 10 minutes into the conversation. The conversation usually starts with ""Are you in the job market"" and then they begin reading a script. So far, I have discovered three types of consultancies

1.Claiming to offer W2 or contractual positions

2. Claiming to offer full-time opportunities

3. Claiming to offer a job after verification of your EAD or SSN

Let's talk about the W2 positions. These guys ask for a deposit anywhere ranging from 500$ to 1000$ and claim to get you a job in 2 weeks. I am told there won't be any contract. After hearing it for the 1st time, obviously many people can make out it's a scam, they will just take the money and ghost you.

The interesting part is all of these people have a LinkedIn profile, probably fake US universities and fake experiences. They post regularly on LinkedIn as well. From what I have researched, they will put fake 5+ years of experience on a resume and probably tell you to lie or cheat in an interview.

**If these guys are ghosting people why hasn't anyone called them out on LinkedIn?**

**I do not see a single post making people aware of these frauds.**

Or if they do offer a job then why don't I see posts about people thanking them as well. Probably because people are scared that their fake experiences will be caught?

The 2nd type of consultancies makes you sign a contract to pay 9% annually or pay a fine of 10K-20K if you don't wish to work at their client for a year or more. They probably also put a fake experience of 5+ years. From the previous posts that I saw, I haven't found anything about these people actually recovering 10K-20K if people decide to break their contract.

**Has anyone here worked with these kinds of jobs and how was your experience?**

The 3rd type is basically calling you and asking you to share the last 4 digits of SSN or EAD to verify you are looking for a job."
Another Pre-Med Thinking About SWE with Some Questions: Interning and Employment,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nw6bty/another_premed_thinking_about_swe_with_some/,[],0.25,1623301481.0,"I am a college sophomore majoring in Q. Economics alongside the pre-medical track at a large public state university; I have been shadowing and volunteering alongside all sorts of professionals in the medical industry and recently felt pretty disheartened by the fact that a lot of them seem to have a cynical attitude about their past training and/or that they're *tolerating* their job rather than truly loving it. **I am not completely over medicine yet** since I don't feel comfortable jumping ship (just yet), but I am keeping SWE at the back of my mind as a possible career I could switch focus to should I find a sure reason to leave.

I have minimal coding experience with Java and have touched upon very basic data structures. Let's suppose I take the scenario where I decide to pursue Computer Science.

**Is targeting a Big ""N"" Tech or FinTech Company out of reach for someone like me?**

Realistically, if I execute the scenario where I leave pre-medicine and major in Computer Science, I could produce a BA in approximately 1.5 semesters or less starting this Fall 2021 and graduating by December 2022. The problem is, this only leaves me with ONE summer to obtain an internship during my college career, and CS internships open this fall, where I'd still be learning Data Structures and possibly seriously lack the expertise that other students have. Not only that, but I'd have to somehow leetcode and adopt personal projects with my minimal experience in time somehow for interview season. I have no networks currently with big tech companies since I have been in the pre-health world. Would being internship-less the Summer of 2022 be a real possibility and if so, then what?

I understand that being earlier is better, but since I'm not 100% about leaving medicine, this decision is even more stressful and I have trouble figuring out who I am.

**How difficult is it to move toward a Big N if you spend the first few years working at a mid-low tier firm?**

Given the prospects of me being late, I can't really demand I get myself into a good tier company straight out college. Is it more difficult to get into a Big N as a college student or as an already practicing SWE?

**Is coding expertise more like a muscle that undoubtedly gets better the more you do it... or could there be times where you're genuinely not smart enough to crack a problem?**

Seriously worried about this one. One aspect about medicine is that once you do the work, you're sure to reap an entry toward the industry; it was very linear and direct, but what about software?

**I am aware that GPA's are not necessities for good internships, but to have a realistic shot at good summer jobs, what range is optimal, especially for a state non-target student?**

**How the hell do you network? Do you even need it?**

**Are there any ex pre-meds here who were late into their education and were in this situation like me?**

**I see TC's figures in mid-6 figures straight out of college skewed by elite, pure software companies off levelsfyi, is that level of TC freakishly difficult to achieve (the way IB jobs are impossible) and what tips do you have for someone who is introverted for breaking into big tech?**"

Have you got any advice on the situation? Should I ask for something just above that limit in case I get lucky?

9 months into my first job and I feel like I'm in a rut. Here's a little background experience.

Graduated from undergraduate with a 3.97/4.00 GPA in Computer Engineer and minor in Mathematics and computer science. Had both hardware and software engineering internships, done freelance software work for 3 different startups, had club leadership experience, plus on my own time, I have been developing a personal automated stock trading program. I feel like I have done everything I was told to do by recruiters, but regardless, I was overlooked by every company I wanted to go to. I applied for probably 25 comp. eng. positions at Intel, NVDA, AMD etc and didn't get a single interview despite being in probably the top 5 or 10 in my class. But not being specifically compute science, it was difficult getting a SWE job because degree was only semi-applicable.

I ended up getting a job as a developer at a Electronic Health Record company. Its a decent salary, but I don't like the location, or work culture, or codebase. But more than not being satisfied with the job itself, I feel like to get a FAANG job, you almost have to have a FAANG job. If you don't have another impressive job on your resume, you won't even be considered for the next impressive job. My failure to get a job at an elite company out of graduation really hindered my ability to set myself apart.

Ideally I would love to pivot into a fin-tech position, (dev or quantitative developer at Citadel is my dream position right now). Does anyone know how I can get there?

Specifically if anyone works at Citadel that would be willing to talk, I would LOVE to connect. I've reached out to about 30 people at Citadel on LinkedIn and no one has answered."

applications, with \~15 cover letters, 4 interviews, I just received my first offer! The compensation is average for a junior software dev in Canada, but I'm relieved I get to make the next step after being in school forever.

**My approach:**

Instead of getting internships and doing leet code (I'm an idiot lol), I just did projects or researched what I was passionate/obsessed about and helped out the family business (manufacturing). I also started applying for remote positions across the country, where the job market is a bit better.

The dots connected and I got a job offer for a software developer position in a research/manufacturing company! The technology they focus on is something I was obsessed with last year.  So, in the interview, I could talk about fairly niche topics in graphics/math/manufacturing.

This subreddit helped me stay positive and confident throughout this process, so thank you all!!! Keep going! CS is a great place to be, internships or not!

**TLDR:** yay! 

Next week: ""plz help, I am confused at first job (new grad)""

EDIT: Moral of the story: even if you screw up internships, GPA, etc., It's possible to recover and actually get a job if you work hard at it."
How to leave a startup gracefully when their whole technology is terrible,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nve5bu/how_to_leave_a_startup_gracefully_when_their/,[],1.0,1623214342.0,"I am a grad school student and been working for this startup part-time for the past five months. There are three people besides me, one CEO with no technical knowledge or tech company experience, two guys both working as a data scientist before (writing R and python during their work). 

The company is trying to offer SaaS to companies, but clearly they all have no knowledge about software architecture, for example, don't know what API integration is when potential customers ask about this (so far zero customers, thus zero revenue).

I have already decided to leave, but I am hesitating about how to say.

There has been a little bit of displeasure. When they assign unrealistic tasks, sometimes I refuse to work so and argue with them. But the three people are all good people and I would like to stay in touch with them.

Do I point out directly that their skills are way too limited to support this business, or just make some excuse saying I need to quit this job?"

Now the product that I'm currently working on is on support and new development is very few and far between, and because this is a small company there's really nowhere to go from here.

 Have I been at this job for too long And will that negatively affect my future? I thought being at a place for a long time would show consistency and dependability, but now I worry that it looks like I was coasting. Now that I'm looking to move on and learn more and become a better developer, I'm wondering if this will look bad on my resume going forward, or if I'm just being paranoid.

Is This Take Home Assignment Too Much?,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvg8a8/is_this_take_home_assignment_too_much/,[],0.83,1623219520.0,"Hi!

I'm applying for junior-associate positions (I have almost exactly 1 YOE now) and have made it through to the final round of interviews for a company.

There was no mention of a take home assignment anytime during the process up until the last minute of the last interview today, and nobody else on Glassdoor mentions any take home assignment in their reviews of the company.

The assignment requires extensive use of AWS and Java (I am not familiar with AWS and have little experience with Java; I made that clear within the interview process).

Here is what the application is supposed to do:

1.) Using a provided swagger file and images, create an HTTP REST-based matching service using AWS rekognition and Java

2.) Build a microservice using Docker and host it using AWS. The microservice will compare each image in an s3 bucket to every other image in the bucket.

3.) Build a UI using React that has appropriate components to make REST calls to the application to trigger the s3 bucket to make the comparisons. The output should display the match scores.

4.)  Present your matching system results and show how you approached the solution.

Also Mentions:

\- Use the most efficient AWS services (such as API Gateway, ECS Fargate...etc)

\- Need to provide documentation explaining code and instructions for testing

\- Need to provide A 1-3 paragraph explanation of the general process followed to approach the problem

\- Need to provide A detailed list of all resources used

Should I attempt this? It seems like a bit much, but again I am not familiar with a lot of the concepts they are asking about. I'm sure some of you can do it in a couple hours, but I'm not so sure..."

Some of us are unlucky and got shoe horned into IT and the cost center classification.

Clearly, if you worked to build the companies product, its pretty easy to identify measurable results for your accomplishments. Even if all you did was improve performance of an existing system, those percentages count for something.

However, often as a cost center your are purposely disconnected from the results of your efforts; writing vague data extract queries for others to analyze, chasing trivial bugs around that end up just being user error or result of ill defined requirements at implementation/development, maybe the occasional automation but without any measure of the impact.

I find myself stretching the truth to list any measure; ""Implemented XYZ that contributed to company increasing valuation over 5 year span by $### million dollars."" Sure, whatever I did probably contributed to the end, but it wasn't the means. Hell, not even sure if it actually detracted from the ends. Things could've gone better had I not done it.

Maybe Im just unlucky to have only ever worked for small companies that cant seem to track impact or significant change over time and associate those changes with specific project success criteria out of all the lurking variables. Stuff is never so clear cut as, ""we measured 1234ms latency average and produced a statistically significant improvement to 345ms latency over 3 months."" It seems all the managers I work with wanting automation aren't actually even tracking their employees time-on-task or general throughput. More likely just getting ground on by their VP/Director/Exec to do more with less so they default to automate regardless of even measuring the issue or impact.

Anyway, before I taper off into another long winded rant, how do you cost center people track impact in a quantifiable way? Are you forcing PMs or BAs to actually produce reports at the end of projects? Requiring management and decision makers produce estimated ROI before the project that is assumed to be the result at the end if successful? How are you getting this information from your managers so you can even know what your effect is outside of your department/team bubble?"

"Accepted offer, but not excited about job. Should I start and keep looking, or rescind acceptance?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvneu5/accepted_offer_but_not_excited_about_job_should_i/,[],1.0,1623242548.0,"Hi everyone. Right now I'm trying to navigate a weird situation. Some info about me and my experience first:

\~5 years of experience and in the US.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately I was laid off in the last few months due to my employer running out of work for me to do, so I immediately started searching.

I was able to get one offer that I declined because the tech stack did not match up with my skillset. A former coworker referred me and it would have ended up being a step back in terms of tech and ultimately didn't align with where I wanted to grow.

I've received another offer, found via 3rd party recruiter. It is much more in line with my previous experience.

I asked for a certain salary and they lowballed me pretty hard, actually going a little under what I was making at my previous job. They ended up coming a little and offering more PTO, but still a couple thousand under what I was making previously, for which I had to really work for (the recruiter really didn't do me any favors here).

They also were very wishy-washy about how flexible they were going to be with WFH in the near future and flexibility in that realm in general. I'm used to WFH basically being the default if I want, especially after the COVID pandemic.

&#x200B;

Their justification for the lower base salary is a quarterly bonus structure (which can technically floor out at 0 in any given quarter, which basically makes it not a guarantee and almost not count from my point of view).

&#x200B;

After negotiating parts of compensation, they wanted an answer within around 2 days, which I was annoyed by. Throughout the negotiating and after receiving the written offer, the 3rd party recruiter was basically just on the side of the company, justifying the exploding offer (saying 2-3 days is standard) and the lower salary (due to their bonus structure being ""how they do things"").

All of these things put a pretty bad taste in my mouth.

&#x200B;

At that point I thought I would receive another offer from a company I was more interested working at pretty quickly, so I accepted the offer but asked for a delayed start date (which is this upcoming Monday) to allow me room to possibly renege if something I was more excited about came along.

Presently, I was informed by that other company that I would have preferred that they want to hire me but would not be able to for a few months, and thus cannot give me a written offer/start date at the moment.

&#x200B;

I've been trying to decide if it is worth just starting this job I accepted so I have a paycheck (since COVID unemployment is going away in my state very soon) and continuing to look and then just quitting if something better comes along (which makes me nervous as I have not quit a position before), or if I should just straight up email them saying something like ""I can no longer start this position"" and seeing if some of the places I'm currently talking with give me an offer.

&#x200B;

One place I'm currently talking with knows I have an 'offer' that I have to give an answer to by the end of the week and wants to get through the process with me before that.

&#x200B;

I'm just worried about starting a job with this negative outlook brought on by the negotiating (I probably would have not gone ahead with talking to this place if the recruiter was better at figuring out what they were really willing to pay, as the recruiter knew what I was looking to make) and then maybe just quitting quickly and wasting their time but having that safety net of a job if nothing else works out.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts? I'm really stuck between

1. Starting the position on Monday and continuing to look, and if something comes along, quitting despite how much time I've been there.
2. Rescinding my acceptance by Friday and continuing to look, but possibly start eating into savings since I technically do not have any other offers right now.

The 3rd option is starting and maybe I end up liking the job, but the decrease in base salary is really not sitting well with me even though they have the bonus structure.

There's also the possibility I get an offer by the end of the week if what I have wrapping up goes well. I've managed to get 2 offers in a couple months, so the search hasn't been all that bad.

This post is a little rambly, but I wanted to get all the details in I thought were important, so if I can clarify anything better, let me know."

When the contract expires, I will get a substantial raise (up around $52k) which still feels weak, meanwhile my brother did a boot camp for 12 weeks and currently makes $80k after leaving his $60k first job.

Social anxiety disorder and internship,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nv7tla/social_anxiety_disorder_and_internship/,[],0.81,1623197683.0,"Hey guys, I started my very first software engineering internship a couple days ago and it's going less well than I'd hoped. I don't have any company supplies, so I can't log into anything. I've been messaging HR once a day (I don't want to email more in case I sound annoying) for tracking numbers/address fixes/random intern cohort meetings, but I still feel so lost and out of everything. I don't know what I'm even going to be doing tech-wise since I need to log into the company email, and it's just been confusing.

I've dealt with really bad social anxiety disorder for a long time, I go to therapy already and I will start group therapy soon too. Needless to say, I can't wait til my next session since I don't know how I will handle any of this. In all our meetings so far there has been such a huge emphasis on networking. The company is really bougie and professional, and everyone is dressed so well, they're from really good schools with tons of experience. In comparison I'm first-gen, low-income, and I transferred into my average public school. I also worked retail for just under full-time these past few years to pay for school and pay bills for my family, so my tech skills are really lacking in comparison. I don't have the time to go partying, do cool projects, or go travelling like other students do. I go to school, go to work, then I come home and draw for an hour and then I need to sleep and do it all over again. I don't know what I'm going to say to any of these people.

I know part of the stress is probably imposter syndrome, but idk I have a feeling like I'm not being completely crazy when I say I might fall behind. I feel like I'm the diversity pity hire.

I really want to do well and not make anyone uncomfortable. I've worked as hard as I could for this opportunity and the money will help me support my family and finish my education. If I fuck this up, I'm worried that I'll have to go back to retail and reconsider studying CS. I wasn't even good at retail either so it's a scary thought.

Does anyone have any advice, criticisms, or reccommendations? preferrably as specific as you can get when it comes to those unspoken rules about communication in the workplace since I'm totally lost and have no one else to ask. What can I do to get accustomed to the work? I'd also love to hear from others with SAD and how yall cope and anything that's worked for you. I do CBT already and working retail was a lot of my exposure, but I still have tons of trouble talking with people I see more than once.

When my boss gives me work, it always requires a 1-2 hour call.  Once the call is finished, I get slack messages every hour or so asking how things are going and if I'm making progress on the task.  To me it comes across as micro-managing and it's draining.    


I get the feeling that when I'm given work, I need to finish it ASAP, even if it means working a 12+ hour day.  Then, I'll have the next day or two off because he hasn't given me more work.  But I still feel like I can't enjoy those days because if he does need me, he'll message me and ask to get on a call right then.  It feels like when I have work, I'm skipping lunch, sitting at my computer for 12+ hours a day, and when I'm 'off', I'm actually on call (day and night).  


I get paid decent and I do have a lot of freedom, but I'm starting to think I should look for something else?  What do you think?"
My most impressive project is incredibly Japanese-esque and I don't know if I should show it off or not,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nv84bk/my_most_impressive_project_is_incredibly/,[],0.81,1623198460.0,"I have a handful of projects that I am happy to show off. However, my most impressive would be the one completed during a Software Engineering class, in which we formed groups and had a semester to make a project. My group was myself along with 4 other Japanese exchange students, so our project was about as Japanese as it gets (No it isn't an eroge). It was essentially utilizing JavaScript, PHP, and SQL amongst a few tools to create a fantasy Gundam (Big ass Japanese fighter robot) store page where you can buy/sell Gundams and parts, featuring an independent server I made to host the database and page, amongst other cool stuff. There's a lot I can talk about with the project, about the tools used, how I learned a new language for this project, team management, ect. However, it's pretty hard to show off and explain since I am job searching in US and everything about the project, from the in-your-face imagery and background is incredibly Japanese, which was intentional because we thought it was funny. It's not like I'm unconfident showing it off, but I kind of cringe at the idea of having to explain to a middle-aged interviewer what the hell they're looking at. I would really like to show it off when job-searching because I had a lot of fun with it. Thoughts?

Also for the record, I am out of school and have been working as a Software Dev for over a year, exploring my options right now"

My current situation is this. I am 31, married with 2 young kids, working full time in production and can only dedicate about 1 hour per weekday and 2-3 during the weekend to learning. My wife is studying to become a data analyst and taking care of our kids. The plan is for her to work and I will be the primary parent. 

I am in no hurry to get a job asap. In fact, we are trying to move to sweden under a student visa for my wife and then figuring out permanent residence after that. That is a whole other thing. 

My questions are: 
What do I focus on from now until when I am going to apply for work(2-3 years)? 
Just work on hammering out front end projects?
Should I figure out backend also?
Should I try and do small freelance jobs? (I wont be able to work fulltime while being primary parent)

I am full invested into getting a web development job and am happy I dont have tremendous pressure to get a job asap. I just want to work on things that make sense and not waste a bunch of time.

How do I tell my friend he's just not cut out to be a Data Scientist?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvyaka/how_do_i_tell_my_friend_hes_just_not_cut_out_to/,[],0.41,1623280507.0,"My 33 year old friend friend has been applying to become a Data Scientist for more than a year now. He's married, unemployed, and his unemployment is eating through his savings to the point where he had to move back into his parent's house. It's a terrible situation for him. But he still trods on intent to becoming a Data Scientist when there are so many other jobs out there for him. 

His work history is just full of freelance work in software. But as a Data Scientist of many years in Silicon Valley myself, I just know that he's just not technically ready to become a Data Scientist. His grasp of analytics is weak, his statistics pretty shallow, and engineering skills not strong yet comparable to an actual SWE. This is shown in the way he's not able to really pass many technical interviews on SQL, python, etc. He's just not competitive compared to thousands of other entry level applicants, yet he's intent on being part of the Data hype. I want to tell him to just give up at this point and seek other jobs because of the material reality he's facing back home. This might be a Sales Engineer, a solutions engineer, a product analyst etc. 

How do I tell him this without hurting his ego and his feelings?"

Hi everyone

I would like to know how to quit remotely to my first job as a new grad.

I kind of hate my job, and my mental health is so bad that is now affecting my physical health. I work in a very small team aka just me and my boss. I want to quit asap but we are also in the middle of a project. I first I wanted to a least finish my project, but I'm to the point I'm doing anxiety attacks just by the thought to work the next day.

We do 2 meetings a day one in the morning and one in the afternoon to talk about what we did and what we gonna do. So my question is how do I tell my boss that I want to quit? At the end of the meeting or a request for a new meeting? It's kind o f informal so I feel it's weird to request a meeting out of no where.

I chickened out each time I want to tell my boss about my resignation. My letter is written I just need to do the talking. I feel need a step by step because the whole thing terrified me for no good reason.

I appreciate any help, thanks!"

Indeed several experienced folks in my network got laid off during early covid and proactively reached out to me. 

For the exact same role and skillset, I started recruiting again in January and the role is still open now 5 months later. 

I've been dumbfounded by the lack of qualified applications I've received this year. Virtually everyone in my network is also hiring for their teams too and other well known series B+ startups in my industry all have many data analytics openings.

The average base comp for earlier career candidates seemed to have jumped from around 110k to 120k ish too based on some great candidates we've lost out on bidding wars to. Curious if I've been uniquely bad at hiring this last 6 months or if other team leads have had similar experiences.

Based on my personal hiring experience there usually a plethora of people with masters degrees looking for a first job out of college, and really it's on the 2+ years of experience that the markets always been super tight. But this year it seems like even with 0 years of experience the great candidates are getting snapped up right away and getting multiple offers. 

We had similar problems hiring for analytically minded excel analyst candidates on our finance team and strategy teams so maybe it's a rising tide lift all boats situation too."

I have strong two offers expiring: one at a BigN, one at a mid-sized company. The team at the mid-size company is more compelling than the one at the BigN, and also has a higher TC and job title. I've also passed interviews at Google but I'm very early in the team matching process - my first team matching call will be AFTER both my offers expire. Already gotten both offers extended to max deadline.

So here's my choices:

1. Decline both offers/let them expire and wait for Google team matching process to complete and receive Google offer. Will lose negotiation power as I am unemployed so can't use current job to negotiate as I don't have one.
2. Accept an offer while waiting for team match.
   1. Receive offer from Google, use accepted offer to negotiate Google's offer
   2. Receive offer from Google and decline

Ethically I wouldn't feel right about accepting an offer, knowing I would leave to Google if I received an offer. Need some advice about what to do about this situation.

If I choose 1. I might end up with no offer at all if team matching doesn't succeed (unlikely) or get lowballed by Google. If I choose 2. I might burn a bridge."

It got me thinking about learning burnout and how it could be different between data science and software engineering since both areas are know for continuous learning and how I don't know if the type of learning for each might be better suited for me/one might cause me to burn out more. Is the continuous learning for the two different? If so, how? Is one commonly more strenuous or no difference? Any other insight on this would be greatly appreciated too, thanks!"

I started my new job almost a month ago now, and I keep feeling like I’m not working enough.

The first week they assigned me “a week” of on boarding material. I spent about five hours a day working on that stuff and finished it in 3 days, to the point that I’m very confident with our tech stack. After that I pinged my manager and they gave me some intro task, that I quickly finished In about two hours.

Since then this cycle has continued. Here’s my daily schedule:

Morning meeting, I tell people I’m waiting on a response from someone.

After the meeting I ping that person who I need a response from to continue working. 

Nothing happens until 4pm, then the person responds. I work on the task with this new information. Around 4:30 I get to a point where I’m waiting on some change/info from someone else, I ping them.

5 pm hits, no response, I repeat the cycle tomorrow.

I would say I do about 1 or 2 hours of actual work a day. When I complete tasks, I ping my manager and they usually don’t give me a new task for an entire day or more. I’ve been asking them if I’m doing things right, if I’m following proper procedures, and they say I am. 

I’m just not sure how to handle this. I keep feeling like they’re going to “find out” and I’ll get fired. Is this normal? Should I do anything differently? Is this just a new hire thing that will start to go away?


Edit: to be clear I haven’t told my managers how little I work, I’ve just asked them if there is a better way to be assigned tasks, or communicate with people to get things done faster. They’ve told me there isn’t."
Got a huge raise in salary.

I was anxious that I would become the next one, but I survived. I think it's because they see me as a helper who can give a bit of help but doesn't need a high wage. So I asked for a full-time opportunity. They said yes, wrote me an offer letter indicating I would be working the same wage as before (which was below average). No problem.

Today I checked my employee information and saw that my pay rate is doubled. How? I was expecting 15-20% in raise but 50%?

How do I approach this with my manager?

&#x200B;

I'm 34 years old and living in Seattle, and after a tumultuous year of family surgeries, the subsequent atrociously expensive bills, and at long last getting properly diagnosed and treated for bipolar disorder, I've come to the realization that I want to be a software developer but I cannot afford to live here anymore. I am strongly considering a move to Kansas City (Overland Park, the Kansas side), because it looks like a low cost of living area with a good tech presence. I have never had a job before in my life (or college), so it'll certainly be a journey, but one I am definitely going to (and probably have to) take. And, obviously, mom and I are going to visit Kansas in a couple of weeks to see how we like it.

&#x200B;

So what I'm wondering, lest I slip back into this awful financial rut, what the clearest and fastest path to getting a software dev job would be in somewhere like KC. What's the best language, framework etc to learn in order to get my skills job-ready in the shortest amount of time? I don't expect a quick fix, I plan on studying and working my ass off, but I'd like to be able to secure something soon. I already know some Python, C++, and some Lua (totally irrelevant in the job world I know, but I like using it as my X-factor). I do have one small game I made with the Pygame module, but other than that my resume is blank. I'm a very extroverted and outgoing person, so I think that's at least something in my favor.

&#x200B;

I'd also like to mention that I do not care at all what kind of field I work in, as long as it's decent money. I'd also like a fairly easy (or at least not suuuper intense and high pressure) job if possible so that I can coast, save money and energy, and then focus on my real passion, solo game development. I'm not going to be paying rent, I don't have any kids to support or anything, and all my life I've lived on SSI payments, so I'm very used to being frugal with my money... so I like my chances of saving up a good amount of cash.

&#x200B;

Anyway, any kind of support, advice, critique, insults etc are completely welcome! Am I crazy for moving away from Seattle to KC? Am I doomed in general? Just let me know, and thank you for (hopefully) reading this!"
Impressive skills to learn to get a front end developer job?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvio58/impressive_skills_to_learn_to_get_a_front_end/,[],0.5,1623226615.0,"I have a journalism degree.

I have two personal projects, one that uses React + Firebase and one that uses vanilla JS, Express, headless Wordpress, etc.

I am very aware of my lack of CS degree and I would really like to get a different job as a front end developer. I feel as though I need to learn some of the more ""challenging"" technologies to make my resume look more impressive.

How to question priorities as an intern?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvdmeh/how_to_question_priorities_as_an_intern/,[],0.75,1623213043.0,"I'm interning at a large Silicon Valley company with a small team that's maintaining a simulator for a chip that another team is designing. My responsibilities are to profile the code, find opportunities for parallelism, and parallelize it with [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/). Except for the few places I've been able to do this, the entire thing is single-threaded.

Now, obviously, they're giving me this project because they want the simulator to run faster. But I recently learned that the code breaks if they use any compiler optimizations. In fact, the sense I get is that the code breaks if even the `-g` debugging flag is omitted (C++ using gcc on linux). That makes my entire project seem to me like a huge premature optimization. In my (admittedly inexperienced) opinion, multithreading by hand shouldn't even be considered until you've exhausted what the compiler can do for you. In addition, I've discovered that some of the advanced features of OpenMP that they want me to use (such as automated SIMD conversions) will have no effect without at least some compiler optimizations enabled.

I really don't want to whine about the codebase or the project I've been given, but it seems that if they want me to speed up the simulator, my effort would be better spent fixing whatever issues are keeping it from working right with compiler optimizations, first. If there are bugs that are only showing up with compiler optimizations, they might have deeper implications. And once the code works with compiler optimizations, OpenMP will be even more effective. On the other hand, I know all too well that telling your superiors that you know better never goes well.

**TLDR:** As an intern, how would you approach telling your manager that they've got the wrong priorities, politely?"
Could this background check result in a rescinded job offer?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvij6r/could_this_background_check_result_in_a_rescinded/,[],0.5,1623226185.0,"I accepted a contingent job offer as a software engineer in the healthcare industry. They are running a FACIS 3 level check to satisfy regulations in the industry. It's a really cool job that I'm excited about. The background check is in progress but they called me and told me they found some (criminal?) record in the state and my start date will be delayed by two weeks while they get the appropriate records. Because my name is common it might not be related to me.

Here's what I know: I had a manic episode and trespassed into a building while it was raining. Was detained briefly, and let go. A week later I threw a rock at a parked car and shattered its window. I was briefly held in a cell and immediately taken to a psychiatric facility. I think those two incidents would be classified as misdemeanors. The third and last incident was a serious suicide attempt for which I was taken to a hospital for a month to treat physical wounds. After that, I was determined to be Seriously Mentally Ill (SMI), my right to own and purchase certain weapons was revoked, and I was court-ordered to accept psychiatric treatment for a year. The year is almost over, and I'm ready to start the job, but I'm concerned that they might rescind the offer if this stuff comes up on my background check. I'm also worried that if they do rescind the offer, I'm basically unemployable.

Looking for advice on career choices,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvhv5w/looking_for_advice_on_career_choices/,[],1.0,1623224202.0,"Hello everyone, I got my BS in CompSci May of 2020. From there I applied to alot of Software Dev roles but because of COVID I ended up having to settle for a Tech Support role in August at a pretty large company, which is where I am now. The pay is fine and up until about 2-3 months ago everything has been good.

A few months ago some major changes have occurred in the company, almost all of the upper management team has left and many coworkers have left aswell. Because of the amount of people leaving, those staying are having to take on a much larger workload (nearly double what it usually is) and has started really taking a toll on my mental health to the point where I just dread work the whole time Im there.

When this all started it got me looking and applying for Software Dev jobs again, and I've managed to land quite a few interviews, but nothing has lead to an offer. I believe part of the reason is that my current job isn't Software Development at all. During these interviews I find myself talking way more about college experience and what software experience I have outside of college, with my current job and responsibilities almost never being brought up.

Because of this I've been thinking about resigning from my current job on good terms and fully pursuing software development again. Taking the time I would be at my job and instead working on learning new software, adding projects to my Github account, just anything to make me stand out for Software Development. 

So I guess my question is, is it smart to take the risk and resign from this job so I can focus on software and standing out to employers, or do I try and stick it out and do whatever coding I can on the side?

Thanks in advance!"
Looking for Technical Workshops/Summer Learning sponsored by Big Tech Companies,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvc2tt/looking_for_technical_workshopssummer_learning/,[],1.0,1623208994.0,"I am currently a rising third-year computer science major with a summer software engineering internship at The Home Depot. I have already begun preparing for fall recruiting for future internships (preferably next summer/SWE role). Recently, I have come across a couple of summer workshops/webinars that are delivered from noteworthy companies such as: 

Lyft's Early Talent Access Program: consists of three workshops that go over their three technical interviews in their regular fall recruiting for the summer. If you are selected within the program, you also may receive a mock interview that (assuming it goes well) can fast-track your recruitment timeline in the fall. (This started today and was found through Canvas which used to be called Jumpstart).

AT&T Summer Learning Academy: consists of a two-week program/externship with training modules ranging from AI/ML lessons to 5G/other company overviews. They give you a certificate upon completion of the course. (Again found on canvas but also on their website)

I am happy with my current full-time SWE internship role, but I still have some downtime and want to capitalize on some of these programs offered by bigger companies (*Especially the Lyft one since it includes a possibility of fast-tracking your recruitment and really breaks down their own technical interviews; technical interview practice delivered by a big tech company is exactly what I am looking for*). 

I wanted to post here and ask if anyone else knows where I could find more programs like this, as there is no common name for this type of program nor a common platform on which to find them. For example, the Lyft program cannot be found on their own company website, you have to google the program name specifically. Obviously, I'm not looking for some random third-party coding boot camp that you pay hundreds of dollars, and I have struggled to find any more programs like this through google searches and navigating through a company's website, so I thought I would post here to see if anyone else has insight or knew of similar programs being offered this summer.

"Extrovert developers, how do you stay energized working in teams of introverts?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvc12m/extrovert_developers_how_do_you_stay_energized/,[],1.0,1623208860.0,"To clarify, since extrovert has a couple of definitions, rather than outgoing, I mean extrovert as someone who is energized by social interactions, while an introvert is someone drained by social interactions. If anything, I describe myself as a ""shy extrovert,"" not outgoing, but dependent on those around me for energy.

&#x200B;

Generally, this personality type works out well for me; after all, software development is a team sport, and in my experience, most developers are ""outgoing introverts."" These teams are very social and the regular whiteboarding, meetings, helping others, and general banter keep my energy levels ""topped up"" throughout the day.

&#x200B;

However, in my current team, I feel like I am running counter to everyone else's energy. Over the past six months, all of the sociable people have left and been replaced by full-on introverts. Everyone in the team wants to spend their day in silence, interacting as little as possible. This situation is further exacerbated by management, who believe that the developers should be spending their entire workday just staring at code.  They have taken great pains to reduce meetings, silo teams, and consolidate all planning and decision-making into the team lead role.

&#x200B;

Being in such a quiet team is starting to drive me mad, I find writing code draining, and without an energy source quickly get exhausted. Every day I find myself struggling to find the energy, motivation, and focus I need to work on my tasks.

&#x200B;

So is this one of those ""move on to find a better team fit"" situations, or does anyone have any advice for working with a team with much different expectations about how social software development is?"

PhD in ML or job in dev?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvayx8/phd_in_ml_or_job_in_dev/,[],1.0,1623206025.0,"Hi all!

I'm  a bit lost at the moment and could use some advice. Most of the posts I  see on reddit are about transitioning from (web)dev to machine  learning, but for me it's the opposite. I'm ending my masters and going  to start a PhD in ML in September and am having a lot of second  thoughts.

I've been doing an  internship in ML and am accepted for a PhD to continue working on that  same project. I like the project and the team but am starting to get  bored of ML, while I've always loved dev (currently i enjoy modern  webdev, but any kind of dev really). So now I'm really hesitating  cancelling the PhD to start working in some dev job (though long term  I'd love to be freelance and have the same liberty as I have in  research). Although I can never know because maybe I just love doing dev  as side projects and will miss having a more meaningful research  project, but right now I don't and 3 to 5 additional years of PhD feels  like a really long time. Besides, I can't wait a year to get some  industry experience and then come back to that PhD, because of  additional constraint I have.

If there are any people like me, who have done a PhD in ML while not loving it and preferring dev, I'd love some advice!

I  also got a couple practical questions. If I cancel my PhD right now I  will have a significant debt to pay back over 2 years. How much money  can I expect to make at the start, if it's possible to estimate, given  that I don't have prior experience nor studies in dev? I don't really  have a big personal projects, just a look of little projects, tools that  I made for myself or some things for fun, or some contributions to  projects. I consider myself pretty good in dev, I've been doing it since  I'm young and still love it, and I love learning new  languages/technologies so that wouldn't be an issue for any dev job. I  could spend 3 months doing an online formation so have a more official  diploma, or spend that time doing some bigger side projects. Or as  another option, for people who have done a PhD, do you think it's  possible to manage a sort of evening dev job to get experience and earn  some additional money, maybe some freelance stuff? This way even if I  end up not totally enjoying my PhD, I'd still feel like I'm not losing  my time, and either way I'd enjoy having a ""real"" job at least on the  side.

Sorry about the incoherent rambling, but i'd really appreciate it if someone has some advice/knowledge to offer! :)"
"What is the future of ""remote positions""?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvoct4/what_is_the_future_of_remote_positions/,[],0.2,1623246128.0,"Let's face it, most roles related to SWE and Data Science (and probably IT project management too) can be easily (and arguably more effectively) performed remotely. I think most of us agree that this is fantastic and to some extent, covid has speeded up the process leaving companies no choice but to try and understand the benefits of remote working.

Now, I want to address the elephant in the room. Skilled SWE/data scientists can easily make over 150k in the US. These positions are going remote. What's going to happen when the pool of applicants will include many third-world countries, where the USD does have 10x the purchasing power?

One may argue that there are different time zones (I don't believe it's such a big deal, but I can see it playing a role), language barriers (definitely not a problem if we're talking about English) and perhaps lower quality applicants (which I think it's overcompensated by the number of potential third-world country applicants). Working visas aren't necessarily a problem if these workers don't need to work on American soil.

I also don't think that wages are dictated only by the value you generate (this sets the maximum you can get paid); wages are dictated by how difficult is to find your skillsets - that's why computer scientists are well paid and ""essential workers"" aren't, despite the latter provide tons of value as well; they're just easy to replace.

Both interviews were very rough as I was asked a bunch of ML questions (most of which I my reply was ""idk"") and one leetcode-y question (which went very well). Even knowing I only had a very high level/conceptual exposure to ML, the interviewer (who was also the founder) hired me. In preparation, I took Andrew Ng's course in Machine Learning and started his Deep Learning specialization, but didn't get too far there. 

My role as an intern would be to teach ML stuff to high schoolers, and make my own projects - there are 3 tracks: NLP, CV, and Reinforcement Learning. This is literally my 2nd day, and I'm freaking tf out. All the other interns are grad students (there's one 4th year undergrad), and me being a rising sophomore I already feel a tad out of place. I'm on the NLP track (I'll be moved to CV and RL later yikes), and I have no clue what the hell is going on. 

All the code looks so foreign to me, and everyone's discussing improvements on the course material and here I am frantically googling stuff that I don't completely get yet. I was able to contribute some improvements to the pandas/numpy material but I have no clue was 'lemmatization' is, what a GPU is, or what a TF matrix is. I don't know how to interpret any of the visualizations, and how anything works under the hood (ex. like I know how to derive a loss function). Worse yet - I'm going to *teach* this stuff next week - and I know from teaching a bit at my university that you need wayyy more than surface-level knowledge to be a decent teacher. 

I go to a university that's known for being stressful but even coming from there, I've not been so overwhelmed/lost/freaked-out. The prospect of going through this with CV and RL is also scary; I just can't see how I'll be able to learn them well enough to *teach* them while doing my own projects, improving curriculum, etc. over the next few weeks. I communicated all of this to my supervisor and he's like ""that's why this is so fun! this is a learning-summer-camp for you as much as it is for the kids"" O.o. Anyone else been in this situation?

Is it okay to at least search while employed?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nv9jo6/is_it_okay_to_at_least_search_while_employed/,[],1.0,1623202178.0,"I am conflicted. I work at a public sector institution that has decent benefits and time off. However, the place makes me uneasy. The most notable instance I have is:

1. I am hesitant about taking time off due to their online time off system.
2. Their online time off system is produced by my own development team.
3. Since I have access to the source, I know the time off system is written in old Web Forms code.
4. The code was also written by student developers, not new grad or experienced developers. The design decisions were questionable.
5. Everyone who wrote the original application left in a mass developer exodus in May. I became de facto boss because everyone else in the dev team is a student developer, now.
6. The student developers are also contractors with no chance of renewal or conversion to FTE.
7. I have begun an initiative to rewrite the time off system, but this was stalled because the customers have not been forthcoming on the business logic I need to create it. The original time off system has defective logic, so I can't reliably use that as a reference. Negative time off, anyone?

For this and other reasons, I want to at least see what's out there. However, a friend I respect has given a counterargument.

1. This is my second FTE job, which is 10 months thus far. My first was also 10 months, which ended due to COVID. If I somehow switched to another job tomorrow, I would be seen as a job hopper.
2. My employer will give me a big payout if I stay for 5 years. I should stay at least until then so I can get that money.
3. If I stay until retirement, I am eligible for a pension.
4. The benefits are good. The time off would be good if I could use it without screwing up the system.
5. I will be given an actual office with a window when I eventually go back to the office. My friend claims this is better than what I could get from a third job. I actually worked in it for a short time when the pandemic was going strong, so I believe this part is genuine.
6. My current position *does* make me a boss/manager of my development team, although I didn't get a pay boost for it. He claims my employer will eventually recognize my worth and give me a boosted salary. I'm honestly not confident on this one, but experience being a manager can have its advantages.
7. Since my superiors have all jumped ship, direction of what to do with my time is up to me. My friend says I should stay so I can learn tech at my own pace. He claims a third job won't give me this opportunity.
8. My institution is backed by the government, and I'm in a union, so there's a good chance I can stay in this job for some time if I want to. Thing is, I fear my skills will stagnate or become strange due to lack of interaction with anyone over a year of experience."

This subreddit has been a brilliant help in my learning so far and I have actually been able to make a few (somewhat useful) contribution to our code. Although there's still so much to learn I've been enjoying the process and have been quite diligent with it (at least an hour a day, every day).

&#x200B;

Last week my manager approached me to ask if I was interested in taking up a junior Product Management role (he knew I was training myself to be a developer), since he believes I've shown the aptitude for it. And I took it, I'm transitioning to a junior PM role in the next few days.

&#x200B;

I apologize if I sound like a spoiled child in the next paragraph, my understanding is that product management is a rewarding career that's not easy to get into, and I should be grateful to have been handed a rare and valuable opportunity (and I am!). But no matter how I think about it I can't help but feel I've made a mistake, PM duties do not excite me the way developer duties do. I like having a tangible output, and dealing in certainties, and the little experience I have had in development has made me feel like this could be something that really fits in with my aptitudes and mindset.

Sure, taking the PM job doesn't mean I can't keep learning on the side, but it looks from every blog post that I've seen online, that there are only developers becoming PMs, and never the other way around. Those articles sometimes frame it as this move being an upwards progression, almost natural evolution, and there is the sense that PM is superior to programming as a career choice. Would it be utterly ludicrous to think about doing the reverse journey? Am I stupid for liking product management less?

On another side, how do you know if programming is for you? One of my fears, that ultimately led to me taking the promotion, was the thought ""What if I turn it down to focus on programming, and live to regret it in five years time?"".

&#x200B;

Apologies for the wall of text, I have mixed feelings about the whole situation, and wanted to describe it as best I can to hear from you guys, especially if you've been in a (even vaguely) comparable situation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you've made it so far, congratulations! Here's a socially distanced high-five.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Committed to teach myself programming 6 months ago, been doing ok so far. My manager offered me a product management role, I took it but have mixed feelings about the decision."
IBM vs. Epic Games Internship,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvi002/ibm_vs_epic_games_internship/,[],0.33,1623224593.0,"I'm an undergrad student trying to decide between an internship at IBM vs Epic Games. Both would be infrastructure-related software positions and on relatively small teams. Which would be better for my career? 

Given that IBM is a larger company, I feel that I could make a larger impact at Epic and the work I would be doing might be more flexible. But are there benefits to the name recognition in the tech industry that IBM arguably has? Would accepting a job at Epic make my skills seem niche (although I would be doing infrastructure work, it is a gaming company)? In the future I'd like to apply to larger FAANG companies.

The situation is so weird that i want your advice before escalating to my manager.,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvbmy8/the_situation_is_so_weird_that_i_want_your_advice/,[],0.66,1623207814.0,"So i started a year back as a junior software developer at a big fin-tech, fresh out of college. The first year i had a really good start, i was delivering all my work, good reviews from manager every quarter and even won some inter division competitions so got some recognition from senior management too.
My manager is really pushing me to broden my horizon, start thinking of larger impact than just of a junior developer.

The problem I am facing is with my colleague; he joined with me at the same time. And ever since i started getting a little recognition, he is always there to pass unnecessary remarks.
 It is from as small as “you work all the time, you want to finish the ticket before it’s created?” to any solution i purpose in our design meetings.
I don’t want the team to suffer, so I sometimes give up my reasoning because i know it will be reasoned against but I can’t slip a single mistake, it creates unnecessary pressure.

My manager wants me to work on my pace and focus on lower level things, business and not just code. I am focusing on that and next thing i know, he pushes almost all the main tickets to his bucket and leave me with a basically one day work and talked my manager to give me all the frontend work since nobody in the group, handling that part of project, had worked on the frontend. 
I like the opportunity to learn new things but I honestly believe I would have gotten more involved part if my manager would have assigned the taks which would have put me in front of clients again.

How can i deal with such a person who clearly pass unprofessional jealous remarks, bad mouth me to fellow junior developers, fills my MR with irrelevant suggestions when not even asked to be reviewed by him. I can’t complain that someone reviewed my code.
It is having effect on my mental health. How should i deal with this?"
Hoe to go about becoming a developer as a career if you are turning 36?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvbk98/hoe_to_go_about_becoming_a_developer_as_a_career/,[],0.5,1623207625.0,"I was working in HVAC as a trainee recently but got laid off due to Covid and now I want to switch careers but I do have an Associate Degree in Computer Studies and I live in the Caribbean.

My idea was learning the C++ beginners guide first to get a hang of programming, I do want to go and get my BSc in Business Computing which I am eligible for with my ASc credits.

That final year BSc is all about Advanced Database Designs in Oracle and developing E Commerce Website in [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET).

So can you tell me if I am on the right track? I am currently putting 16 hours a day study and I plan on doing it for 1 year until my savings dry up. Would this be enough time to gain the required experience to get a junior role as a dev?

Also does it make sense starting off with C++ and finishing the videos I got on youtube?

My conundrum is do I complete my bachelors while working full time or just work full time, get the experience, and move up to a mid level job in a few years? I am currently enrolled at Ferris State University in their program for developers and also in the honors program as well. I haven't signed up for fall classes yet, because I wanted to weigh my options here with returning to school. 

Do I work full time and go to school part time to keep working on my bachelors? It will take almost 2 years of full time classes to complete, so if part time probably 4 to 5 years at 2 classes or so per semester. Or do I just keep working full time as a dev now, get the experience, and in 3 to 4 years look to moving up to a mid level position? 

I am leaning towards just working because it would be less stress than having to work and do classes. I know that experience outweighs a degree eventually but will I miss out on important classes or opportunities by forgoing school to the bachelors level? 

I'm really torn on what to do and don't want to ruin my prospects for my career by making the wrong choice here. Any advice from those in a similar situation and what choices you made? I'd have to do a few more gen eds and my core classes as well and the degree has 30 credits in business as the degree itself is heavily business oriented as Ferris' program is Comouter Information Systems as a Developer.

I've spent the last 10 years working with HTML, Javascript, PHP and CSS. At the beginning of my career I thought of doing websites as a secondary form of income, but it slowly became the focus of my career, which I'm thankful for. However, I never studied computer science formally, I am completely self-taught, though I do have an undergrad degree in something else.

Making websites made me money, but it was never that much, and I haven't been able to afford any real forward momentum in a long time. In my free time I would code in other languages like C++ and C#, but only in the context of video games, and my knowledge in those languages is relatively shallow. I've got a good grasp of programming and the main difficulties I have now are more with learning libraries for languages instead of the languages themselves. When I pick up a new language, it's more about learning that languages conventions and norms.

About a year ago my house was invaded by armed men and they took almost everything I own. My girlfriend at the time fled the country and I've slowly been rebuilding my life since then from the ground up. The cops are completely corrupt here and haven't done anything at all. I am extremely anxious to leave this country but I am stuck here due to not being able to earn enough, and of course covid regulations.

I'd like to change my line of work toward a language that is more in demand and pays more, so that I can build a better future for myself. I'm sure that if I took a junior position in a company for either C++, Java, Javascript or Python I could quickly catch up and start producing professional work, but I have very little to show that would put my foot in the door. 

if I know what direction I should take I can focus my effort on building programs that I can present to a company to show that I am competent. I've seen and heard that Java brings in a lot of money and can provide a stable career. C++ seems to me, from the outside, to have the most applications in game development, but I know it's a low level language and it seems very useful, just not sure what the demand is like. I've got the most experience with Javascript so making apps with nodejs and the mean stack seems like a solid choice and pays a lot more than websites, but I don't think as much as Java, and I don't think it's as flexible as Java either. I met a web app developer a few years ago who told me that Python was better for web app development and he went off to get a job in Switzerland. 

I work long hours, but I study hard after work. I also work weekends. I can't really fit in a comp sci degree between work but I don't think I can afford it either. However, I can put in the time and effort to learn a programming language and produce a portfolio for it. In your view, what would be the best language to learn, and do you have any other advice?"

This one thing could be holding your career back in Computer Science,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvhy2l/this_one_thing_could_be_holding_your_career_back/,[],0.44,1623224437.0,"Ever thought to yourself that even though you are perfectly capable at your job, or maybe even the most knowledgable person, you are often underestimated in your role. Or worse, you find someone else (even though less capable technically) making the decisions and telling you how the project should be handled. You want, ask and expect a new opportunity or an exciting project from your leadership, but you simply watch them go to someone else in quiet despair.  


You feel under-appreciated, ignored, and mostly misunderstood. You probably have several great ideas for your company, but if only someone were to listen to you.  


I work with several people in Tech, IT, and Data Science, and this is such a common problem that I encounter.  


The reason for this is ‘Perception”. See, there’s a big difference between being an expert vs being perceived as one. Being an expert will help you excel in the opportunities you land in, but how people perceive you is what will land you in opportunities in the first place.  


Almost everyone is focused on honing their technical skills, which by the way is a great pursuit. But most ignore the art of basic persuasion and charm which keeps them from getting truly satisfying roles and opportunities.  


So how does one gets perceived the right way…?  


It has to do with the way you communicate. Experts have a way of talking that automatically demands compliance, respect, and conviction from others. Think of your last visit to a doctor. Did you argue with the doctor, or just wondered in your head that they probably know nothing, or simply dismissed what they asked you to do? Instead, you complied with whatever you said.  


Effective persuasion is a learnable skill. Once you make a few key changes to the way you communicate, the environment around you and the way people treat you changes dramatically. You will command respect and unquestionable trust that will get you elite opportunities in your industry. So you can later prove it through your capabilities.  


When you present something, people will just tune in to your reality as you speak. In fact, they literally will come to help you with your work even when you don’t ask them. All of this happens subconsciously when you know basic charisma and persuasion."

I am a developer with a few years of experience and I have a question for all of you and especially seniors.

 I hesitate between entrepreneurship and remaining employee. Being an employee scares me because I feel like I depend on my employer, the job market and its whims. I am afraid that I will one day find myself stuck because of my age or my abilities. 

I also see some developers who are not fulfilled but do not change jobs for fear of finding nothing elsewhere or that the situation is the same elsewhere. Or who are afraid to change career for fear of losing their income levels. 

How do those who have been employed for a long time to deal with these fears please? 

I feel that even if I remain an employee, I should create something on the side to give me the freedom to choose. I would like to have the freedom, for example, to take a year's break without worrying about whether I could easily find a job after.

 Do you feel those fears or this need for security? 

Do you think it's a mistake to stay employed without creating anything on the side or not?

How to approach teaching a junior?,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nuypk4/how_to_approach_teaching_a_junior/,[],1.0,1623164705.0,"I work in a small team that consists of a junior, me (mid-level) and a senior. When I jumped into this project I was surprised how little the junior knew. He came from an SQL role to test out front end development. He attended a short bootcamp earlier and thats all his experience in programming.


I spend a lot of time every day explaining his tickets to him. I told him he can call me any time and we can look at the problems together. I had the idea that I'll hold his hand for the first handful of tickets until he becomes self sufficient and gets more confident in our dev environment and our coding style.


When I started out as a junior, I had self-studied and taken a couple really demanding uni courses on programming so I was pretty comfortable when I started my first job. Its been now 6 months that Ive helped this junior and I just got off a call with him. Not to sound harsh, but he demonstrated that he doesnt understand that variables arent visible outside of their block and he wasnt able to store a boolean in a variable.


I want this dude to get better, I want him to be excited, I want him to feel the good feeling in the tummy when he gets something working correctly.


Right now, though, we arent meeting our project deadlines because us more experienced need to help him out on basic things so often.


Im also worried that this way of us intervening with his work makes him acquire learned helplessness instead of becoming self sufficient in problem solving and googling.

Unsure if I will be able to land a programming job,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nv5ba6/unsure_if_i_will_be_able_to_land_a_programming_job/,[],0.6,1623191318.0,"I recently graduated with a BS in Computer science, I went to a small state school and kind of half-assed my way through things. I got decent grades (C’s and B’s) but feel as though I did not retain much information. I’m worried that I kind of wasted the past 4 years in the sense that I still don’t feel like I know how to program. 

I had an internship during school but it was IT work and I didn’t do any programming. After graduation I started applying to places but struggled during the coding assessments and didn’t hear back from any of the software development jobs. I ended up landing a job as a network engineer but now that I am about a month in I’m really starting to hate the job. I can tell that it’s not what I want to do and the work itself is very uninteresting to me. I would really like to work with code but am afraid due to my lack of experience that I won’t be able to find or hold a job. 

So now I’m at a point where I don’t know what to do. Do I stick with the IT/networking field and hope it gets better? The pay and benefits are decent but could definitely be making more programming. Is it going to be hard for me to find a job with only IT experience? I want to start refreshing my programming knowledge but I’m not sure where to start, it’s been about 6 months since I’ve done any coding."

Most most of the recruiters I've talked to have mentioned that they're looking for someone with more experience, and it seems like 95% of the postings themselves are looking for either new grads or someone with 2/3+ years of experience.

Is this just an awkward middle? If I'm not having great response rates right now, are things actually likely to improve once I hit two years? Part of me feels like a chunk of these companies could just be HR seeing I haven't hit that threshold and throwing out my resume before anyone with tech experience even looks at it, and that I should just wait a few more months and try again. But I also don't want to just sit around and wait. Any advice or perspective would be appreciated."

Now, I know ""simple"" isn't really a term commonly associated with software engineering, but are there any CS fields that are better about this?  Can I ever hope to find a field/position that uses only a few languages/skills, and has some stability as to what those are, or at least a field where it's understood that skills are transferable (if I've spent five years with a language, I can probably figure out whatever their framework of the week is) ?"

&#x200B;

I currently work as a digital marketing specialist with some data analysis thrown in using some self-built scraping tools etc, nothing fancy but it was a start, and in my latest annual review I mentioned wanting to become a devloper \*one day\*.

My intention being saving up enough money to go travelling and then do a bootcamp or self teach when I returned home.

However, my current employer has started giving me on the job training, which is great, although we mostly deal with wordpress stuff which is really not what I'm interested in. With the view that eventually (6 months ish was the timeframe given) i'd be able to transition to being a back-end dev, no need for a full-stack / front end role as we've got plenty of those but only one main back-end guy who i'd be working with, also currently my team leader, and a really great guy, get on very well with him and he's a great teacher.

By the end of the training my team-leader (mentor?) says we'll cover the following areas, which i'd then pick up as my actual job and drop the boring digi marketing stuff.

&#x200B;

* Python (for the data analysis/science, which I will continue doing in a minor capacity, but more maintining my scripts than coming up with new stuff)
* PHP Templating - The crappy wordpress stuff that i'm really not that keen on, but it's a foot in the door
* Gatsby / React work, the direction my team leader wants to push our company towards. So react & JS stuff I think?

A third option would be to just do the training and if it goes nowhere and I feel like i'm getting stuck as a wordpress ""developer"" I could just use this opportunity to get some experience and then do the boot camp anyway?

I'm not really sure what I'm asking here, just a bit lost and want some advice, it's a lot to process and I have nobody in my life who knows anything about development."

They’re pretty stable, they work in e-learning and are contracted with multiple Ministries of Education in MENA. It was a huge opportunity for me (25 with 3 years of experience)

I called company X, explained my situation and why i’m going to accept this offer. The HR person was upset. Said i should’ve said anything sooner. I told them I got the offer 12 hours ago. They asked me to send and email and wished me luck then hung up on me without waiting for my response.

I’ve been sending out applications for dev roles the last ~3 months, but overwhelmingly get the auto rejection emails. In most of the interviews I do land, employers seem more interested in what I do at work than the projects I have recently built (but at least now I can describe what I do better than “clicking a deploy button in bamboo and killing processes/queries when the business says things are running slowly”).

On my 2nd day, I needed her to let me in as I didnt have my office ID given yet but she didnt even reply to my message or answer my calls...I felt so embarrassed and after that I said ok thanks I got in and to that no reply as well. 3rd day she came because the project manager who had to pick me up asked her why she didnt pick me up but she was asking judgemental questions and giving me judgy eyes the whole time. 

After that, she gave me some documentation to go through but when I am stuck and tell her in the group chat, she doesnt reply (its just me, her and another developer who are in the chat). Sometimes the other developer helps me but other time he says he doesnt know and tags her with her @ to help but she doesnt reply. I feel...very lonely and abandoned, maybe Im too much in my feels but I try not to be, I am getting worried that I may be fired soon as I only got done setting up my environment and creating my first service in 1.5 months...

Every monday, we have a team online call with the whole company and today she said she had nothing much to do the whole of last week and was calm but she didn't reply me last week at all despite several messages and coming online...

She sent this to the main chat after another meeting, I wasnt in the meeting but Im quite sure this is about me:

""@⁨name of project manager  as mentioned in the stand up just now.. I assume the new members (I am the only new one so this is just me) wont be on time to start doing the Low water/no water SDD, am I right..
so will be assigning @⁨anotherperson to do the Low water/no water SDD. as he (I am a she) is new and dont know much detailed regarding this document, he might need a bit more time
and if eventually, if we hand this module to them to implement the SDD might not be accurate will incur unnecessary conflict.

@⁨anotherperson , please pause the fixing of IM issue for now and focus on the Low water/No water SDD. thanks!"" 

So Im kind of sad and confused...? I dont feel motivated anymore and im losing self confidence. Because I did ask and no one helped me, and she is assuming there will be conflict working with me? But she didnt even talk to me or get to know me..I know my only option is to leave this company but I also kinda dont want to leave this company as it is a good company and I like the project but Im really sad right now about this whole thing"

I also have ADHD, but hey that's not getting in the way here.

I work for a small-ish company, our technology team has 2 full time engineers (I am one of them).  It's all very nice, and I mean it's really nice as far as my culture ""fit"" is concerned.

Except... I get paid about 1/3 of what I'd make at another company in my area.

&#x200B;

\--

The company I work for is in a low-medium-COL area, and I live in a medium-high-COL area.  Should I base my salary request on where I live now, or where the HQ is?

Lets say I make $50k, and local postings are $100-$150k for similar experience.  FAANG is paying $200k.  These are not too far from what the actual numbers are, I've spent countless hours researching local jobs postings salaries, compensation, etc.  Total compensation for other jobs is 2-3x my current salary, and FAANG companies are 4x.

There are a lot of luxuries, but there are a lot of downsides too.  Primarily there is no one to learn from (or tell me no), and then the salary.  I've certainly dug myself a hole a few times before.

For me, with my anxiety, finding such a good culture fit just seems like a one-in-a-lifetime thing.  But that's probably the anxiety speaking (sounds stupid, I know).  I'm open to looking elsewhere, but would absolutely love to try to make it work here first.

My direct line manager told me if I think I deserve a raise I should ask for one (multiple times).  It's just difficult for me to wrap my mind around it.

I've needed to ask for this raise for years.  Our mortgage payment bounced today, my internet bill is overdue, my only savings exists out of pure dumb luck, and I have no retirement to speak of.  These are not things that are supposed to happen to intelligent & educated people in steady jobs, right?

It's really hard.

Degree vs certificate?,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nupfio/degree_vs_certificate/,[],1.0,1623133560.0,"I’m currently working on my second semester in community college taking classes to earn an associates in computer programming. But I am stressing from doing the work on top of my full time job, and all the money that needs paid on top of my aid. So I just wanted to ask the question, is it necessary? It almost feels useless taking classes where I learn nothing about programming. Would it be more beneficial to just attend some sort of coding camp/class for a few months and learn almost just as much there as I would for my entire degree (there’s only like 3 classes for actual programming 2 are for c# and 1 for web based stuff like html and JavaScript. Which isn’t really what I want to get into) 
So I guess my main question here is, what did you do? Did you get a degree? And even better one than mine? Or did you most of you slide by, by just getting a certificate and learning only what you need to in your free time? 
I didn’t really know how much job recruiters care about degrees or if they just look for experience. I also wanted to try and get on Fiverr once I learn enough about programming that way I can get experience. 
Sorry if this all sounds naive or stupid but your honest feedback would be really appreciated. I am just looking into exploring my options. Thanks!"

I have a 3.9 GPA (granted it is Kinesiology) but I have been excelling in PA school as well(4.0). I've always believed with a strong work ethic, anything is possible. Am I fooling myself in thinking I could make it in tech? Time and time again, I hear stories of people making 200k+ in tech working 9-5(40hr/week). To make that much as a PA, I'd have to be doing 50-60hrs/week.

Regarding if I could even tolerate coding, I have indulged in coding, and have really enjoyed the challenge; don't love it, don't hate it.

If i were to drop out and jump into tech, I would most likely be enrolling in a bootcamp in the interest of time (25 years old currently). Am I just digging a hole for myself by not obtaining a CS degree?

I went through three interviews and they all went very well - phone screen, live technical, and a final behavioral with the CTO on May 12th. The position is full-time salary and not a contracting position.

I sent a follow-up email to HR on May 17th asking for more details about where my application stands. They responded by saying that there has been some changes in the needs for the position from one of their biggest clients, so they couldn't commit to any offers until the client resolved their needs. They needed about a week or two for an answer. HR also said that they were/are going to make me an offer depending on whether their client decides they need more developers.

Ten days after the first follow-up, I sent another email to check in on the situation. They told me that they still didn't have a definitive answer. HR told me they believe they'd have an answer for me in a few days (sometime last week) and that she will definitely reach out when she has a final answer, but I've yet to hear back.

I've been waiting for quite some time to hear back and am getting impatient, but I don't think I'll send another follow-up email since I've already sent two.

I would love to give them the benefit of the doubt for a few reasons. Everyone I've interviewed with seem like pleasant people and I want to work with them, but at the same time the situation isn't looking great. Additionally, I assume their bigger clients really do have a say in financial decisions since they're a smaller company, but I might be completely wrong about that.

Am I just being strung along or is the company really just waiting on their client to give them the final word on the hiring decisions?"

How do I tell my current boss I'm leaving for my old company?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nuuj10/how_do_i_tell_my_current_boss_im_leaving_for_my/,[],1.0,1623149364.0,"I decided to go back to my old company after 2 months. 

I left on good terms with my company A to follow some of my coworkers to a new company, B. Company B was not what I expected, and feel somewhat misled about the culture and state of affairs at the new company by my coworkers. I don't hold them responsible or have any ill will about it, especially since one of them was apologetic about not giving enough context. 

This morning, I signed an offer letter to return to company A.

I've known my current manager at company B for a couple of years. I respect him. He took care of me as best he could, and I'm not leaving because of him. I plan to inform him in the morning about my decision to leave.

How do I best handle this in a respectable way? What should my messaging be to my manager to let him know I'm leaving? I was advised by my father -- an intense hard ass -- to be tight lipped about it, not tell them where I'm going, and only offer 2 weeks notice. Inevitably they will learn I returned to company A, so I'd rather be honest and control the messaging. 

I was tempted to give them a more gracious 3 or 4 weeks notice, and leave my projects in a good state, so they get some value from my time with them, _and_ be honest with them about where I'm going. I don't expect to be done dirty, but anything is possible -- maybe they ask me to leave right away if I tell them where I'm going. 

I genuinely feel upset that I have disappointed two companies now, and two sets of managers. It truly wasn't my intention. But again, I also felt misled and pressured about the role at company B. 

There's a host of context here, but it would be a novel to type out. I think this is sufficient to guide answers, but I'm happy to discuss more in depth if there are specific questions."

1.) Join the workforce.

2.) Go to school for a CS related masters.

3.) Go to school for a BS in a foreign language (I don't care about job prospects but it's something I enjoy and will be an easy time for me).

Money isn't a concern, spouse and I have no credit/debt and have about a year of emergency savings, plus we're completely sustainable on my spouses salary alone. My concerns are:

1.) I might miss this easy opportunity to get a job directly dealing with CS and will have a harder time breaking into the workforce later. Also I hear Oahu doesn't have much of a tech scene so it'd be smarter to snag a job while I can.

2.) I'm just burnt on life right now. This past year of personal problems and going to school and working full time just wants me to take option 3. But I'd be willing to bear with option 1 if it means my future is easier, plus I won't be dealing with my personal issues or school anymore.

I also took a few CS classes but didn’t do well in them.

I don’t code in my free time, so I’m rusty. There are a lot of fundamentals I lack a good understanding of (like OOP, inheritance, polymorphism). I also lack knowledge of theory like operating systems and networking. The BIGGEST thing I lack though, is problem solving skills. I’ve always struggled with breaking problems up into chunks, putting the solution together and getting my code to run.

I want to prepare as best as possible for this role, but I’m having trouble knowing where to start and how to get a comprehensive education online.

The team I’d be working on focuses on satellite communication solutions. The tech stack consists of COTs and customer hardware running on Linux-based systems. The backend software mostly runs as plane Java applications or microservice-based Typescript/Docker-based apps. Most of the frontend software was migrated to HTML/TypeScript-based web frontends based on Angular or React.

Currently my plan is to take a programming fundamentals course in Java to refresh and try to understand what I didn’t before. Then I was thinking I should do a project to practice and actually learn.
Then I’d do a web dev course and try to build a React app as a project.
I also need to gain knowledge on using Linux, CLI and Git commands, how satellite communication works, etc. I’m pretty much starting from scratch.

I have about 6 weeks to do all of this. 

So my questions:

Is it feasible to learn this much and do 2 projects in 6 weeks? How many hours do I need to put in weekly to achieve this?

Can you recommend any resources you used to get better at problem solving & writing good code? (Specifically in Java or JavaScript)

Any learning resources that helped you really understand difficult concepts?"

I am realizing I don't want to do web dev work, and would like to get into machine learning, so this experience is likely not important if I go to grad school. However, if I decide I need a job in the next couple of years, this is my only experience and I haven't even been here 3 months."
Considering going back to college to pursue a degree in CS at 28 even with a decent current job and no debt. Advice?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nur4ed/considering_going_back_to_college_to_pursue_a/,[],0.43,1623138535.0,"Hi,

Reposting because didn't get enough replies. Please hear me out.. I'm currently a Regulatory Affairs Analyst at a medium sized company that manufacturers medical devices. I graduate in 2017 with a Bsc. in Biology and got a Masters in Regulatory Affairs in 2019. My current pay is decent imo, about \~$85,000, since I live in a MCOL area. No debt and about \~250k in savings. I've 5 years of experience but I've been heavily debating moving into a programming career.

Why? Long story short, I had early brushes with programming when I was young and hated it. I was scared of programming to the point that I made a mental block in my head and just told myself that it isn't my cup of tea. The only thing I liked at the time was Biology so ended up graduating with a Bsc. in Biology. I realized my degree wasn't probably worth much so figured I'll do a Masters to increase my job prospects and my income. I have a decent job now but I'm extremely burnt out of doing administrative work. I don't see it being challenging and my salary will probably top out at $120k-ish in 5 years. I'm single right now and have a lot of free time to do something productive on the side and figured I'll try programming again since I always sort of wanted to get past that mental challenge. I started doing a **Python** bootcamp on Udemy and I'm loving it! Looking back at programming after all these years has given me chance to think about it with a fresh perspective (instead of always being nervous/anxious about it. And hence, never trying to logically understand it).

I graduated with \~140 credits so if I go back to my old college to pursue a degree in CS, I only really have to take all CS 100 thru 400 level courses. I don't need to take any math, english or elective courses since I already fulfilled them with my current degree. I'm thinking may be 1 or 1.5 years of studying. So:

1. Does it make sense to go back? I have enough savings to sustain myself until I graduate. I'm thinking of extensively coding at home during the time I'm in school. Basically coding full time for at least a year, getting my foundations strong, doing practice exercises, learning back end frameworks like Django or Flask, etc.
2. I'll be 30/31 when I graduate. Will age be a factor when I'm trying to find a job? Do you think I can get a job after graduating that pays me similar to what I'm getting right now ($85,000)? I'm on the East Coast, Tri-State area.
3. What do I do?"
Should I just quit?,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nu0rbs/should_i_just_quit/,[],0.84,1623058135.0,"I am one month into my new job and I absolutely hated it. I am currently WFH but the company has announced that everyone will return to office at the end of the summer.

At first I thought it was a great opportunity. It’s a great company in the industry. I was offered a better title and substantial increase in salary. The hiring manager likes my background and seems to be an easy-going person.

However, things took a dramatic turn before I even started. I was told the day before I started that the HM who originally hired me has left the company to pursue a better opportunity. And as a result, one of my colleagues was promoted to become my manager..

Ok no big deal.. Even though I was a bit worried since the new manager had no prior managing experience...

Then when I started, things has become even worse.. The guy who’s supposed to train me is a total jerk. He’s leaving the current team to another team. I was hired to replace him.

He would purposely withhold information or give out incorrect information that prevent me to do my job. He wouldn’t stop trashing the big boss ( my boss’s boss) in front of me. He kept hinting that the big boss is difficult to deal with and created many unnecessary work in the past.. 

I thought maybe he was just holding grudges due to their previous disagreements. I tried to change the topic whenever he started the rant and communicated to my manager that I was hoping to get more support from her so I can get the information from that guy and do my job...

I work in finance. And unfortunately I had to inherit a lot of the financial models from the Jerk since he was the only one who maintains those models during his 2 year period at the job. And it’s very bizarre that a lot of his models are products of hard coded numbers. So to understand where the inputs are coming from and what needs to be updated, I have to reach out to him for help. I was very polite and patient with him at the beginning even though he would ignore my email/messages or gave me incorrect information..

I was so frustrated so I reached out to manager for help. She would told me to ignore those data then it would turn out that I actually need to update them.

I didn’t blame her at first since I know she didn’t have much knowledge on the topic..But soon I realized she’s just as bad as he is. When I say good morning to her, she would never say it back. When I asked her for guidance, she would also just ignore me even though she knew I need to turn in the analysis to the key stakeholders of the company with a pressing deadline.

She would also gave me instructions to focus on certain tasks and ignore the others. Then later it turns out all of those need to be completed and she would only tell me right before it’s due. She also told me I need to take more educated guesses on my own while those analysis will make an impact on company strategy.

I don’t understand what I did to her to deserve such treatment... I have been nothing but nice to her. Now I have the feeling that she didn’t want me as her direct report but inherited me anyways. I always maintain a good relationship with my former bosses so this situation makes me feel very uncomfortable and unmotivated.

Other coworkers seem okay but I just got a very strange overly guarded vibes from them. 

I also found out the HR who recruited me recently left the company after staying for one year...

I am not planning to put this job on my resume so I am thinking maybe I should just quit and take sometime for myself.. I felt miserable every day at this job even when I wfh..but I also felt like maybe I should just suck it up until I find something better.. 

I have a new hire check-in with the vp of HR next week. I want to be honest with him of my onboarding experience but at the same time I know HR probably won’t do anything..

I was a top performer at my previous company and kept a good relationship with my former boss. I felt very embarrassed to reach out to her because she countered offer to make me stay. And they have hired someone new for my previous position..I felt like I made a big mistake switching job when working remotely.. I really hate to be a quitter but this job makes me so unhappy.."

Did you fuck up as bad as me in the past?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nup8lz/19_aspiring_developer_rough_few_months_failed/,[],0.44,1623133030.0,"Been having a rough couple of months especially after the semester ended and I failed 2 classes, should I take summer classes?

Hello everyone, currently In community college and finished my first year. My second semester was a living hell, my first semester went great but I ended up failing 2 computer science classes last semester which through me into an ultra depressive few months that I am still trying to work out of.

I am currently on financial aid, and pretty much everything is being paid for which im extremely extremely greatful for.

I need to retake those two classes to get back on my own personal career track. If I take these 3 classes in the summer (calculus, programming and critical thinking) I’d be able to graduate still in 2 years. If I don’t I would imagine I have to do one more extra semester to get that done.

Completely unrelated to college but I assume a lot are going through, I’ve been having a smoking addiction these past months and it’s destroying my life. Im basically almost broke from the two semesters financial aid money (I was able to pay for my education, books and other personal expenditures). I’m shit with money and it’s something I’m. Praying I work on everyday to better, but if I go into the 3 classes over the summer I’d basically be 100% broke after book spending.

Is it worth it to go in the summer like this. I want to fix my gpa which retaking one of the classes would do, but I literally won’t have any money over the summer. I am currently trying to do my own personal game dev course and self learn because I rlly do want to get into comp sci despite hardships one goes when learning new skill. My parents don’t ask for rent as long as I’m in school and learning on my own. There is a lot of pressure and stress at home but I won’t go into detail for time sake. They don’t recommend me getting a job because they did the same and want Me  to study at home instead and pursue and work on something at home like a project or business instead of working for someone else and wasting time to develop yourself on someone else. 

This is an amazing dynamic and I’m so grateful but at times personal issues, family issues and finaincial stress get in the way. Since the start of COVID it’s been hard. We have had to move, lost jobs etc but everyday we work towards our dreams. I am really stressed and feel burned out, and I hate myself for even thinking this because I am just a lazy 19 year old college kid who knows nothing about the real world.

I feel stuck. Should i take the classes into the summer? i feel as if i dont i would feel extremely guilty for not doing so since my parents assumed I was going to for a while. I would also feel extremly like shit because of my failed classes being there the entire summer without me doing anything else towards the classes. i know summer classes aren't mandatory but i just dont know what to do. i also don't want to have $0 over the summer because of any expense that could come. my parents tell me as long as they see me deep into learning on my own and stuff that i wouldn't have to worry about that stuff. but as a young male, the concept of earning money and cash on hand is so attractive. if i do get a summer job i feel deep down they would be disspointed, and i also do really want to develop my own solo developing career. I am just stuck in this constant cycle of not knowing what to do, and in turn I just waste time doing none of the stuff i want. i am not sure if depression or anxiety is the asnwer to how I have been feeling lately, but it feels as if for the past few months my life is falling on top of me and I dont know what to do. 

i am constantly stressed, worried, anxious the worst is gonna happen. not sure if i should do A because B and C might happen. i also am fighting a smoking habit that i just cant break. i just feel so god damn helpless. 

would appreciate to hear anyones opinion, advice or anything. just feeling like theres no point anymore, and that i should just give up, go to minimum wage job, save up, work, go home, smoke, and repeat until im old and grey"

I graduated in May with my bachelor's degree, and by August I started remotely as a full time firmware engineer at a well known company. In December, I moved 2,000 miles to be onsite. I'm not loving the job, but I figured a big name would look really good on a resume, as well as give me some decent experience.

This company is pretty big on hiring from within, and my best chance of getting a full time job with them in the future is by going through the internship program. But even then, it's not guaranteed. 

My question is, is it worth it? Is it worth leaving my full time, salaried position to chase this dream job?

As the title says, I’m debating whether or not to leave my first job. I graduated last year in Math and Statistics, with the hopes of going into data analytics and eventually data science or software development. I did risk management as well, but I’ve only worked with sql, excel/vba,some R, and and intro c++ course, so I’m trying to self study languages at this point.

Well, basically I never found a job (my coding skills aren’t advanced at all) so I tried a data analytics mentorship which was geared in media and got my first job as a media analyst at the end of the year. My coworkers and upper management are great and kind, lots of days off, pretty decent entry pay plus bonuses, rarely days where I work past 5. Only thing is the I’m not very fond of is the work. Its not bad but There isn’t much analytics aside using excel and making dashboards and pivot tables, and I feel like I’m not learning much anymore, mostly just media buying and planning..

Last week, a recruiter from a much bigger media company asked to interview me about a data analytics position, where you’d use python, sql, and more software which I’m interested in. The interview went well and I’m set to speak with the team lead tomorrow. If all goes well, I’m expected to join in two weeks after the offer.

If I do get the job, I’m not sure what to do..I’m starting to feel guilt even though I haven’t been offered anything yet. The new company will give might be the same salary or only a few thousands higher than what I’m currently making, but I feel the work may be more rewarding. A lot of glassdoor reviews say lower salary and terrible work life balance is typical of this media agency, which makes me a little nervous..

If given the opportunity, should I take the offer? Or stick with my company. My coworker says our boss is good with creating a career path based on our interests, but the next review is in two months, and even then I dont know what opportunities I could have, or how long it’ll take..I took to reddit bc I don’t have many people I could talk to about this so if you guys could tell me what you’d do in my situation that’d be lovely, thanks so much!"

How do I get a gateway CS job as a 17 year old?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nulv6g/how_do_i_get_a_gateway_cs_job_as_a_17_year_old/,[],0.5,1623124484.0,"I am 17 years old, duel enrolled in high school and college so I will graduate next year with an AA in CS and a high school diploma. I plan on attaining a master's degree in computer science. I have no real certification. I run a small tech support business within my town and do low intensity tech support for community service. Because of this, I have access to many positive recommendations if needed. I have gone to some CS camps(ID Tech) and have small programs that I've made which are mostly just webscraping in Python or random stuff in C++, which I have posted to my GitHub. I believe my skillset makes me most compatible as a software engineer. I have never had a 9-5 job, and never a CS job besides those employed by me.

&#x200B;

My question is: where do I look for jobs that will help me make a successful CS career? Am I too young and uncertified to get a real CS job yet? Should I just go with a 9-5 job in a restaurant or start looking for jobs that will actually advance my career? 

Also, would it be smart to learn mainstream languages like Ruby before I go job-hunting?

I've been with single company my entire career. The company loves me but after 6 years it's become extremely boring and unchallenging. I'm 26 and I'm thinking of switching jobs just for the sake of experience. Thoughts?,568,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nth47d/ive_been_with_single_company_my_entire_career_the/,[],0.94,1622997045.0,"Hi all! So for the past 6 years I've been with the same outsourcing company as a full stack developer. I've gained a lot of experience and progressed extremely well. I'm 26, and the most valuable experiences I gained are:

* Team Lead for couple of years - closely monitoring people's progress, mentoring, helping out
* Software Architect for couple of years - worked with clients to translate their requirements into software. Planned and organized releases, managed client expectations, played around with cool new technologies etc..
* Interviewed probably around 50 people for the company, mentored around 20 junior developers 
* For the past year, I've been a Lead on a project of \~40 devs, qas, etc.. I've been managing the ""big picture"" of the project, so things like a roadmap, process improvements, technical improvements, resource allocation etc
* Had a chance to do project elaborations for 5-6 new clients, so things like requirement gathering, MVP analysis, design...

I've been working mainly in mortgage and real estate and got extremely familiar with how it works in US, even though I'm from a 2nd world country in Europe. I've worked on enterprise applications and with one of the leading names in this domain. 

And company loves me for it, they can see that I actually **want** to work and are gladly giving me more and more responsibilities. I'm probably earning way more than I should at this point. I'm not bragging but I do think that I do an amazing job and because of it I have a status in the company of 400+. Everybody knows me, everybody trusts me..

*But I'm bored.*

Not sure why, I can't really pinpoint it. The job description is entertaining and I really like the idea, but I'm simply not enjoying it as much as I thought I would. Some of the reasons I can think of right now are:

* No challenge. I've grasped all the ins and outs of the project I'm working on. I haven't had a problem in years which I couldn't solve under 2 hours
* Monotony and boredom. I know the industry domain, I know the clients, I know the codebase. I'm familiar with *everything.* It's super boring.
* Company culture. Not related to my project, but I'm starting to dislike company's strategy and culture changes they're making. They started focusing on revenue over quality which I don't think is the route to take at this point
* Comfort zone. Most of you will see this right away from reading the post, but I **am** in a comfort zone at the moment. That isn't necessarily a bad thing because I have a pretty big salary to fall back on and I don't pour sweat and tears into the work. BUT, it is scary to think of the next 3/4/5 years, where will I be, what will I do etc... 
* No clear future goals. I've hit the peak for what I can do here. Neither company nor my direct managers know where can I go from here, from this position. I've said MANY times I'm way too bored at work and want to take on more responsibilities. The only thing I got offered is to do more project elaborations, which is interesting but not a lot of fun because *I can't work* on these projects - I just do an initial analysis and if clients sign with the company someone else takes over (because I'm stuck on current project).

In a nutshell, I've no idea where to go from here. My job is nice, I have pretty cool coworkers, a huge salary and both company and my direct clients just *love* me. All of this is nice, but I'm not happy at work. Out of 40 hours per week I can probably say that I enjoy up to 5-10hr. 

I understand this is the work I do and not who I am and it's ok to have a boring but a steady and a safe job, but... maybe not at 26? I have so much more to offer and learn... 

I almost feel like that, even if I was *mostly happy* at my current work, that I should still think about switching jobs just for the sake of more experience. To see and feel something different. To make a ""name"" for myself somewhere else, same as I did in this company.

So what do you think? Have you ever been in a similar situation, what did you do..?"
Are developers to blame for poorly written user stories,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nukbte/are_developers_to_blame_for_poorly_written_user/,[],0.5,1623120960.0,"I've been at my current gig for around 8 months and I feel like I've been doing well - in terms of getting up to speed. 

But the thing is, my team is not very well structured, the biggest issue is that the business analysts/product owner have very little domain knowledge. 

As a result, user stories are often lacking features and requirements. For instance, the acceptance criteria will only include a high level flow of what is to be achieved and many of the details such as validation requirements (business related validation) and other business rules are being left out. 

As a developer, I simply implement what the user story and acceptance criteria say but then, the QA process ends up finding a bunch of issues that I was not initially aware of. 

Putting this back to the BAs and POs gets this response, ""the developers should ask more questions to clarify the requirements and they should read up on the documentation [which is kept separate from the user story and isn't fully up to date])""

Now I agree with their point to an extent in that I should try to clarify, but my job is develop and write code etc not analyse and set the requirements. That should be done by the BAs and POs, no?

At the very least, the BAs, POs and QA should get together to define what they want done, right?

Am I missing something here?

What's worse is that the there isn't any sort of sign off process at the end of sprint to say if something is done or not, so tickets end up dragging over multiple sprints!"

However, my luck is not clicking with big name tech companies and my resume is getting rejected at initial stages.

I got my resume reviewed a lot of times and posted it in this sub and other subs and all said I have a very impressive resume. I also applied via referrals but that didn't help me in any sensible ways. I have given up getting anything from those faang companies as intern/new grad.

So I just want to gain some insight from people who couldn't secure a new grad/intern role at any faang companies or any other major tech companies (IBM, SAP, Splunk, Lyft, Uber etc) but later secured a role after few yoe. My questions to you are:

1. Is it a faang company or any other major company that you secured your offers from ?
2. How easy/difficult was it for you to get/secure an interview?
3. Did you apply online or a recruiter reached out to you on Linkedin/email/phone?
4. How difficult was your interview? Were you able to provide the optimal solutions to your problems on the first try when interviewing?
5. How long was your interview and how many rounds?
6. Was there any scaling/role changes (for example you interviewed for SDE ii but they gave you an offer for SDE 1)
7. How long did you prepare? What was your preparation schedule (like 2 hours/day doing leetcode, 1 hr/day doing system design etc)?
8. How many leetcode have you done (I would really appreciate if you list something like x amounts of easy, y amounts of med, and z amounts of hard etc)

New job - Ask for opportunities to grow,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nukajc/new_job_ask_for_opportunities_to_grow/,[],1.0,1623120871.0,"Hello all

I am an experienced IT professional that just moved into a new job after 11 years with my previous company. Even when I liked my previous company, my role and responsibilities, since a few years ago I was looking for a new role and responsibilities (lead, supervisor, manager etc) within my same department (IT). Unfortunately that never happen and was not going to happen, so I decided to look for new opportunities somewhere else. I found this new job but basically at the same level I had before but with the hope that with my experience I can grow in the short to medium term. Have to mention, this new job even when it is within the IT department it is a completely new things for me, (most of my experience is IT Management/Administration and Manufacturing and End User support), however this new job is more on the Production and Application Support. I have been 1 month in the company and basically all has been training in the system I will be supporting (since this is a system developed internally I was told so that I can get on my own with my responsibilities it may take at least 6 months or even 1 year). This of course was not within my short term plans, even when I knew I was moving into the same job level I previously had I was expecting to be able to grow and show my value faster so that then after a year or so I be asking for a promotion, however seeing that my ""training"" only will take that time I am affraid I will be stuck again. Also, I am not sure how to approach to my manager and ask about promotion being that I believe they are going to say ""you know what we are putting a lot of time with your training so moving into a different role or promoting you is not an option at this moment or after a year or so"", so my question is thatm how can I  approach my manager and talk about this concern?

I know being in a new job and company completely out of my comfort zone is overwelming and I get that (is only 1 month) but I dont want to get to the point where I feel frustrated and want to give them an opportunity. The company has been very flexible and they basically gave me everything I asked for, however I am not sure how to manage my concern above, so any advise would be really appreciated from people more experienced than me.

Thanks in advance."

i have been working as ""the tech\\systems person"" along with another person on a non tech company. my job is mostly installation, maintenance and administration of the web server and database server and SQL development for our website (it mostly calls stored procedures for its backend). most of what i do i learn when i need to do it, most recently ive been managing an oracle database and learned a lot about it and plSQL development.

i also have some knowledge in C,C#,php and have some light exposure to java. though im not proficient in any of those languages.

i want to emphasize that im not an expert DBA, when i have a problem i investigate the solution and try to implement what i found, but i have no expert knowledege of the inner workings of a database, or a web server.

im wondering what should i learn to find a job in a tech company, is what i do enough, should i learn more about database administration? or is it more realistic to take java or c# courses and find a job as a developer?

1. What do quant traders really do?
2. What  kinda questions are asked in the interviews and how should one prepare  for them? Are there interview prep equivalents of CTCI and Leetcode for  quant trading roles?
3. How  hard is the job really? I find software engineering hard enough coz we  need to stay updated with technologies, understand complex code bases  and other people's code, build stuff with strict deadlines and then keep  our interview skills sharp by practicing leetcode. How much more  difficult is being a quant trader?
4. Does the job entail coding? If yes, then what percentage of the job is coding and what technologies are used?
5. Is there some list of companies that hire quant traders? I know only about the popular ones like Jane Street and Citadel.
6. Do  all companies that hire quant traders pay them well? This seems to be  one of the highest paying professions, but I still don't understand why.  Do quant traders really possess such a rare skill?
7. How easy is it to switch from software engineering to quant trading and vice versa?
8. Since the past 5 years, a lot of people seem to be pivoting into tech for the  money and there's nothing wrong with that. Quant trading pays much more  than tech, but I still haven't seen folks trying to become quant  traders. What might be the reason for this? What's the barrier to entry?
9. How's the demand in the industry for quant traders? Is it gonna go up or down in the future?
10. What  are the expectations from a new grad in terms of educational  qualifications? Do they need a PhD in Math from a top 3 school or will a  CS grad from a decent school also be eligible for the role?

And all my coworkers and team leader put pressure on me like, why cant you help him out, etc. That guy is in a very good relationship with my manager and directors.

I feel guilty, because they all look at me like im some heartless asshole. Meanwhile, they all pitty him but dont help themselves. 

like before going home, they say should we help you? They know in advance, that they cant because dont know their job, only i can help him . so they look in good, and im in bad light.

The only dilemma, my new position would require me to be in person 5 days out of the week. Is it a bad idea to switch to my ""dream job"" if I have to return to in-person work? 

I understand that dream jobs are usually just that, *a dream,* but I can't decide if doing work I feel passionate about in-person is worth giving up being remote almost full-time.

I am 28 and currently working as a senior data scientist in a large bank. I am well paid, 2-3 times above the average salary in my country. Have been in the organisation for nearly 4 years and didn’t get the promised promotion due to circumstances beyond me (although each year I was getting a somewhat decent pay increase). I am tried finding new roles within organization but unsuccessfully - either I didn’t have management experience or wouldn’t want to abandon my current field of data science altogether. I feel quite stuck currently, however, it’s a very comfortable and safe job to be in.

I just got an offer to join a tech company, which is still in a rather early development phase. The offer was somewhat lowballed from my expectations, however, it would still offer a 20% increase. The job seems to be more exciting. Sometimes I feel like dying in my current job during the meetings- personally implementation of SAFE Agile feels like a religious cult with endless and pointless meetings. The recent reorganisations in my job and the implementation of SAFE resulted in absolutely lowest point of my personal motivation, moreover, many colleagues have left as well. Nevertheless, the new job would be a bit worse shift wise - people are scattered across US and EU thus some meetings might end at 8pm (not terrible but not ideal either)

My current job is secure and within my comfort zone, have additional benefits like more holidays, additional pension plan, stock options, gym, good private health insurance (not US, so less relevant). I basically live stress free life. Also, the office is next to my home and is amazing. Overall the benefit package more or less equals the pay difference between the jobs.

So is it worth it to leave my current well paying and extremely stable job for a tech startup with a 20% increase but fewer benefits. If it was at least 30%, I wouldn’t be posting this here…"

Now this is my last month of the contractual agreement and I'm not sure whether they're going to ask me to continue part-time, for multiple reasons:

a) I'm currently working as a Front-end developer for them (React) and they hired two interns to help with frontend, one would be me and the other a final-year undergrad who was significantly more experienced in React (and generally web dev) than me since the start.

b) First month was very hard for me, the whole process of learning a new language and then the framework, being put on a brand-new product development cycle and was expected to make visual components for them. I didn't do well at all and my mentor sensed that and moved me to bug-fixes for their existing line of products (while the other intern continued to work on new product).

c) In the last month, I've been getting better at identifying issues and completing my tasks on time (relatively). But there still have been places where I'm lacking due to either lack of experience with the tech stack or just awful time management.

These are the reasons I suspect they won't offer me to continue working with them after the end of my internship, and that's completely fine. They're a company and they need to manage their resources as efficiently as possible, I get that. I would say my time with them has been absolutely amazing (if not stressful at times but that's part of the package I guess), I have learnt a lot of stuff by getting my hands dirty on how the development cycle works and I can't  be grateful enough to them for it. The company is amazing, the people are very friendly and helpful, the product is cutting-edge and exciting to work on.

Now, my dilemma here is that I'm scared that I had a golden opportunity to continue working with them but I blew it by not performing up to the mark. I was struggling with React since day one (have gotten better at it loads since day one but still major room for improvement). I love working here and would absolutely continue with them if they ask me to but I have to be realistic if they decide to part ways. Considering that I want to (eventually) transition to fullstack, what should be my next move? Apply for more internships (continue with frontend or maybe apply to backend ones?), apply for an entry level part-time job (i've seen a couple of listings and have gotten a few calls from companies that are looking for an entry level web developer) with local companies where the tech stack isn't going to be amazing/exciting but the work will be easier, or should I just focus on personal projects until graduation?

I’m 25, just finished a marketing bachelors last year, and found I like coding much much better. I’ve been teaching myself since last March and I just got out of a 4-month Bootcamp where I learned Js, and have been learning React since that. If I could, I’d get a bachelors or masters in CS now. I need a full-time job desperately, though. Preferably web development or UX.

I love React and was planning to keep learning full-stack (building my portfolio site w Next.js), but I came across headless WordPress (with React, Gatsby or Next and GraphQL). 

One of the 3 interviews I’ve had has been for WordPress, and it seems like there are a lot of Wordpress plugin developer jobs, some with Js and React. I want to avoid putting my time and energy into learning Php if it won’t be to my great advantage, though. Time is precious right now.

As I said, I’m not attracted to PHP and I’m seeing a lot of negative sentiment towards Wordpress and Php, besides some interesting responses [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kceb27/help_me_to_decide_to_go_mern_stack_or_to_learn/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf). 

I also am not opposed to doing freelance but it would take considerable time to set up a ‘package’ that includes me handing off the website when done, which would be essential as I’m looking for a full-time job.

I don’t want to work with Wordpress in the future, I’d like to be free of any CMS and do development and engineering, probably mostly frontend, but maybe ease into full stack as I learn. I want to meet and work with real engineers/scientists in the industry because it genuinely interests me!

I don’t know! Getting a job is really important right now, but I don’t want to pidgeonhole myself into working with CMSs, since I love doing design from scratch. Headless Wordpress makes this possible but will it be a bad look in the future? 

I need to leverage my marketing degree as much as possible, so I’m thinking that may be easier with Wordpress (freelance sites w SEO for small businesses). 

The coding part of me doesn’t really want to work with that backend though. I also have a lot of passion project ideas, including collaborative annotation. I’m open to learning Java or C++ to bolster my resume and or get those projects done, but I wouldn’t choose PHP if not for this situation.

Thoughts? I’ve seen the question asked, but it may help to know my specific situation. 

tl;dr: 

25 y/o marketing bachelors, self taught React and Python, did a bootcamp, need a job!

regular SE. I love having a simple, unassuming, position where I just put in my 9 to 5 monday through friday fixing shit or adding simple brain-dead features, while listening to some Pandora.

I love the simple joy doing my simple work of problem solving well, and then im out by 5pm so I can get back to my gardening, or cooking dinner, or enjoying some TV / gaming time. I have zero desire to be part of some new thing, app, feature, etc, though that doesnt seem to stop my fellow colleagues and bosses from constantly trying.

And in the middle of all this, I recently realized why I despise the ""tech"" culture. I hate interacting with my colleagues and coworkers, and the progressive culture surrounding software development.

It seems normal for everyone to be this arrogant elitist hyper competitive know-it-alls. And they sure are hell bent on playing this ""one-up-man-ship"" game constantly.

What spawned this rant was this past week, some little punk got annoyed with me because my pull request got approved, while his got rejected, on a project he and I were working on. 

He wanted to escalate the issue and argue with our boss (and his boss's boss) why his shouldve been accepted (the senior devs explained why it was rejected in the notes), and wrote this long email to me basing his whole reasoning on ""*...everything is so wrong with the company when they can accept a [my] request from some GED having college dropout coder wannabe...*"".

I dont know why, but ever since that email (he apologized later), its been festering in my mind ever since. And its made me realize how much I can not stand developers, and the tech culture in general.

I love what I do, I enjoy it. The things I dont enjoy... Are other software developers"
How much will my income rise by moving to the US?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nu904v/how_much_will_my_income_rise_by_moving_to_the_us/,[],0.44,1623090122.0,"I'm currently a software developer in Benelux. As a contractor my hourly rate is €90, and that is for being a senior Java developer in the corporate world. With around 1900 billable hours a year and 21% VAT added that means I am able to bill my clients around €200k to €210k a year. But after paying tax, business cost (laptop, software licenses, train card, conferences, business travel) and social fees my net income is only around €100k.

Which is why I'm considering moving to the US so that I can have a fair wage that actually compensates the work I put in and that reflects my skillset. It would also be nice to finally be able to afford a family home near my place of work, something that is simply impossible in the Benelux region (forget about it in Luxembourg or the Dutch Randstad).

I'm able to move to the US on the H-1B visa or through E-2 (Investor). I've read online about compensation at large companies of up to $400k pre-tax which seems like a reasonable amount for my type of work but I'm wondering if that is an achievable amount. I understand that it highly depends on the region that you are in and I also understand that the cost of living can be higher. I currently pay around €5000/year for healthcare and I suspect that to rise to around $20,000/year but that should be manageable on my projected income. Housing in the EU is crazy right now and I expect to pay a lot less for housing in the US.

Is there anyone who made the move from (Western) EU to the US and how much did your income rise?"

I'm hopeless,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nu2y9h/im_hopeless/,[],0.67,1623065723.0,"I've been trying over a year since I graduated with a Master's. Jobless for a year and depression that went away awhile ago came back. Nothing excites me and it's incredibly hard to find motivation.

There was a family trouble and now we are without a home and living in our family friend's house, and I'm living in a small room with my mom with no space to put a desk. I've been using a drawer and a bathroom stool as a desk and a chair, and I'm sleeping on the floor. I know this is personal but it's so sad that companies don't care. I feel like I'm gonna break down whenever interviewer asks me what I've done after graduation. A YEAR WITHOUT WORK?!?! I had a family issue that I had to deal with, so I couldn't work on any project or portfolio, but they absolutely do not fucking care. Why should they choose a guy in mid to late 20s with a sad story and no work experience when there are so many other younger and more competent people out there who are excited and motivated. I wouldn't hire me if I were them.

I hate myself for doing Master's because it cost so much and I don't want anything to do with what I studied. Got Master's and no job, I need to find a way to pay the loans.

I need to get out of here but I basically have to start from the bottom. I'm very directionless and I'm hopeless. There is not really a point in life. I feel like I don't know shit, and I forgot everything. I don't know how I got to this point in my life. I fucking hate myself.

I know people here don't care and will tell me to cheer up, but I just needed to vent."

What I’m currently doing is making a crud app with Node/React. It’s taking forever to finish because a majority of my time is trying to figure out design choices so it doesn’t look amateur without even having a complete idea of what I want it to be capable or look like. 

My other project is a web scraper.

My 2 other projects are from school, a binary classifier and backend in JSP for a crud app (front end is barebones html). 

I’ve applied to probably 600 positions now and have recently been applying to only start ups. I’ve had 1 interview failed with a startup and 2 phone screens to which they never got back to me and later said they won’t be moving forward.

I'm gonna be honest I don't like this person they were disrespectful and mean not just to me but to everyone in our office. I was the only one to report their misconduct to our managers which began an investigation in which it sounds like  lots of negatives people had with this person across the organization came up and they were fired. So they did receive some comeuppance.

Still It annoys me a little to know someone who considered themselves superior to me and all of our other coworkers is  taking credit for the work we did  .  

Part of me says the real horror is that other companies are paying this person because I know what a nightmare they were  to work with and I should leave them alone.  Part of me is petty and infuriated that they are stealing my work and claiming my work as their own .  


I guess my question are,  is there anything I can do about this?  Secondly and  realistically besides a minor annoyance and a fun conversation is there any value to me pointing out their dishnoesty. right now ?"

Switching from Data Analyst to Software Engineering. Would you take lower pay to do something that will pay more years later?,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nty60t/switching_from_data_analyst_to_software/,[],0.71,1623049584.0,"I’m a data analyst right now. Have about 2-3 years of experience. I mainly use SQL everyday. Company is using Looker so I’ve been learning that for the past few months. Used to use python at times for my previous job but not here. I do use python for side projects and freelance webscraping gigs. I want to transition to software engineering.

1. Pay would be significantly higher down the road in few years. I can hope to make $150k or so within 3-5 years. Data analyst doesn’t get paid that much and beyond. Unless I transition to Data science which I can with my stem degree and experience. My current pay is above the $80k initial salary by almost 20%. So being a Junior software engineer would mean I could take a significant pay cut. Starting salary for HCOL as a junior Dev seems to be around $6-$80 or so. I’m pretty sure it will take me 3 years or so to get to a 6 figure. 

2. I can go remote in the future. With software engineering I can work remote whereas data analyst and data science doesn’t really have that much of a remote job. I want to go to different countries and work from there 6 months at a time, etc. 

Has anyone made this transition? I have a stem degree so learning the material is not the issue for me. Would you make this transition? Would software engineering me much more lucrative and more remote opportunities than Data?"

First Job as SE,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ntq71y/first_job_as_se/,[],0.83,1623027494.0,"So I'm just coming up to the end of a software dev bootcamp and need a few pointers from the more experienced!

Does anyone appreciate this sub-reddit....,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nubhle/does_anyone_appreciate_this_subreddit/,[],0.38,1623098245.0,".....but get increasingly terrified with how much people in here say the following:

1. If you're NOT social you're just NOT going to make it

2. Elitism is at an all time high/wiseacre co-workers (and some management)

3. More office politics. 

4. If you're a woman, you're more likely to not be taken seriously

5. People WANT to see you fail. 

6. If you can't think logically, you'll suck and you'll get fired (succinctly put) 

Bonus: Teamwork is everything (I'm not a fan of teamwork, but if we're aiming for a common goal, then that's fine/if the people are nice, I don't mind. I don't mind talking about the work that we are doing, but see #1 because that's mainly me). 

Like I am new to this field and I'm a student aiming for a Computer Science degree. My #1 fear is well, #1. Ironically people mistake me for an extrovert and I haven't the slightest idea why. For the most part, I'm quiet once I get to know people (odd isn't), and I'm just not really a big talker unless it's something intellectually stimulating. I'm not an elitist, I don't think that I'm better than anyone, it's just that the main things that people talk about, I don't do. I don't watch TV, I don't really go to the movies, I'm not on Facebook/IG, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't party, I study mostly, but I love nature, meditation, reading, and learning etc. I'm nice for the most part, but if someone runs me the wrong way, I have no issues ""clapping back"" at someone if needed (on a more normal scale, at the very least investigating what happened between myself and someone). I'm also a questions person, and I ask questions for days, because I want to get a full understanding of what I'm doing. It took me MANY years to become comfortable with asking for help as I used to not do it at all, but in this field, I also hear that asking questions is taboo/scorned at. 

I'm seeing so many people burn out, complain about stresses, I DEFINITELY DO see some (many) gatekeepers posting and wiseacres emerging from the shadows. I just want to make it. I started in January with the hopes of helping my father out with his business and finishing something that I THOUGHT was going to be simple, but then I never knew that I was going to enjoy coding and figuring out languages and problems and stuff like that (I don't know why actually since I naturally do love to solve issues that I care about). Idk. This subreddit is DEFINITELY great, but the more posts that I see of this nature, the more that I begin to question whether I'm making the right choice career wise.

Edit: I don't like office politics and tbh, I thought that I was going to get away from them with being an SWE/Front end developer. I guess I was wrong. 

Also, I'm a woman. I think that women need to be respected in fields that are male dominated, just like males are respected in fields that are female dominated (i.e the men who do hair or do nails for women). 

Why would ANYONE WANT to see anyone fail? That's just BEYOND ME. Like shouldn't we all be proud of the accomplishments that others make? I mean I get the envy, I really do. I get envious at times, but that doesn't take away my happiness from someone getting a promotion or something. It just ends up being like ""that's wonderful that XYZ got promoted.....but when will it be my turn?""
 Like that's how I've felt at times.

Edit 2: I'm not the most logical person out there, so besides #1, the whole logical thinking thing also bothers me. I don't want to work my ass off, just to realize that maybe I'm just generally a shit coder and then get canned on month 4. 

Apologies for being so long, but I've been wanting to write this for A WHILE."

The codebase itself is pretty big but is also badly maintained and almost entirely untested, meaning that often times things that beak would go under the radar for quite some time and any changes are very likely to fire back at you in some point which can be frustrating. 

After a long interviewing process with one of FAAMG, I’ve received an offer that pays slightly better, and I would guess that it’d also be more challenging technology wise.
However, what’s completely unknown to me is how the team is, what the work-life balance is, how bad the commute is (it is about twice the distance from my home to their offices than my current workplace).

I tried to weigh the two options and I think that what draws me to the offer is the fact that I’ll have more challenge, while also having a nice listing on my resume.

When consulting with friends and family, they all immediately said “go for it” like it’s a no brainer because it’s a really big company.

Would love to hear your opinion, what would you do? would also appreciate any tips on how I should decide what to go for.
Thanks!"

I changed the minor into a major and i’m currently registered as a double major student pursuing business management and computer science. I thought I was okay with this set up until i started creating my schedule and if i want to finish both i would be in school until 2024. With just the cs degree i would finish a year earlier and graduate 2023. 

My question is if an extra year is worth it to have a second bachelors in business management. Keep in mind this extra year would also add to my overall expense and simultaneously delay my cs degree as well. It just sucks bc i only have nine classes left for the business major and it does leave a sour taste to think i did so many credits for no reason.

I am in my final year of my engineering degree program in CS. I learned and built a pretty good portfolio in my first 2 years of college and I have been working as a developer for the past 1.5 years. I joined this startup as a dev to build their MVP. While the job role was that of a Fullstack web dev, across the past 1.5 years I've pretty much built their entire product except for 1 component of their product.

I've pretty much built these things in their product,

* Website using Next JS
* Backend Business API
* Mobile app for iOS and Android using Flutter
* Data streaming pipelines using Kafka
* Admin panel to be able to control these things from a single interface for internal use

I'm a bit surpised that I was able to learn so fast and build these things out. I feel like I've overachieved at the role considering this was my first rodeo as a dev. Especially considering that I was the only guy working on these things so I had little to no help from any peers in cases where I got stuck, it was on me to try and figure something out. I think I did a good job cranking these things out within such a small time frame. Moreover, the product is more or less stable with no obvious bugs or crashes in its current state except for minor things in the UI/UX.

So I talked with the founder about a decent sized raise, considering I was hired as a Fullstack web dev but ended up pretty much building out and handling 80% of the tech side of their product. Only thing I didnt do was Machine learning, mainly cuz I don't know anything about ML and there are 2 senior devs who are handling that portion. The reply I got from the founder regarding the raise was that I have to wait till they get funding. This is a bit disappointing as I am not willing to stick around for an unknown duration in the hope they get funding.

I am considering leaving the role as I feel I'd be able to get better offers than what I am currently on. My CV has if anything grown, I have much better portfolio now that I have worked with all these different tech. I am not exactly sure how to have this conversation, either they give me a raise or I walk. It's awkward and as someone whose bad as is in normal social situations, I have no idea how to initiate this conversation!!

I need some advice / help on what to do.

Edit: I for some reason feel guilty considering leaving... idk if it sounds very selfish of me. "

It’s also not just about the money since they are basically the same.

Tech stacks are similar, future tech is similar — but the reason I was leaving in the first place was due to some issues that I could technically resolve with management. I am very valued at this company and they are willing to do what they can to make me happy.

New company could be fun and exciting and offer more opportunities for growth as well.

Worth it for a university student developer job?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ntv7yn/worth_it_for_a_university_student_developer_job/,[],1.0,1623041244.0,"Howdy folks,

I've just finished up here with my third year at a big university, currently with a major in Data Science and Analytics (BS) and a computer science minor (BS).

I'm currently working very very part time as a developer for a family business developing a web-based desktop application to improve workflow. It's paying well enough - $20 an hour, but the hours are so limited I'm considering persuing something better for my resume and to take up some more of my downtime over the summer and final year of university. 

I am being offered a job here at the university research facility as a student developer. One notable thing is that the research facility is pretty well regarded in the research community and I do believe it would be a great addition to my resume as a titled developer. They're asking for 35 hours a week over the summer and 25 a week moving into the school year. This seems fine to me, but the pay they're offering is only $12.15 an hour, which certainly irks me.

My question to ya'll is: Do you think I should pursue this offer? On one hand, it seems like quite the low-ball, as with both prior development experience and many years working in technical fields, I believe I'm qualified for a $20+/h position. On the other hand, having a local, stable job very close to where I live, and taking a job which I feel will sit very nicely on my resume has its perks, though I'm not just the perks justify the low wage. I will try to negotiate to something like $15 an hour but I have my doubts they will take that, given it's a university position which are generally not predisposed to giving decent wages. Thoughts?

I've been slowly but surely teaching myself web dev, front end. Its been 2 years but i did what I needed to do and got a job offer. The thing is, I make $150k now, but I am super anxious about the future of my career. 

Some additional info:

* 33 years old
* single dad with 2 kids and an elderly parent who gets SSI
* current job is comfortable, but coasting type job with great benefits, but stagnant in growth and highly dependent on a certain industry (the fall of Detroit has me extremely worried about being industry dependent)

With that being said, I personally think that web development has a higher income ceiling and more recession proof than the industry I'm in now. 

The web dev job i got an offer for is paying a little over $60k. I can do it, but I'd be cutting it close, possibly stunting my retirement a little and cutting down on the luxuries like eating out. Probably won't be contributing to any retirement plans, but doable for sure.

We just hired a new developer, he is supposing to be senior developer with around 6 years of experience

we already explained him the main process of our app, we also explain him everything before each task

But each time he has the tendency to bombarde our slack channel of questions about every thing for his current task, 

its like he expect total guidance or something... 

also sometimes he doesn't know why a certain piece of code does , when it happen to me i simply do some research on google, or i try different tests, and if i really don't understand i will ask to the other developer that made it... but i think when i started with that company Im sure i didnt ask more that 2-3 questions by week...

So i'm wondering, after how much in the company asking so many questions would be considered like too much? or if he doesn't well bye bye...

How are you guy responding to this kind of behavior?

I personally don't answer to him anymore... since i'm expected him to find the answers by himself like I used to do...

but since i don't answer anymore he is now annoying other developers that seem more patient than me....

&#x200B;

For me asking a question should me something like this:

\- First i do some research on google

\- then i checked our previous PR, our documentation

\- then I try some stuff

\- then if i really feed that not knowing the answer might takes me well more time that it should take me Then I ask

\- when i ask a question I write it well, with some code reference.

isn't that a normal process of asking a question!!?

Still, I have concerns about how it will look to leave my job without having another job lined up, and if that will show poorly when I start applying to other jobs.

I have enough money saved up to live off of while I crank out the masters degree, and plan on still doing personal data science projects in my free time like I already do.

Is this “career suicide”?

Currently I have saved up enough money to live for a few months without working, and if things go very badly, I could always move back in with my parents, since I'm single, and I don't live far away, so I'm thinking that the risk is fairly low, but the potential payoff might be high if I succeed, and I think I have a decent shot.

I hope the ""pause"" won't look bad on my resume, as I can always write/say that I was working on my personal project during this time. 

I already started working on it, but after a full day of work I rarely have the energy to do much, and I use the weekends to wind down and do things I couldn't do during the week, so I think doing both (taking a new job and working on the project at the same time) isn't a viable option if I want to finish it anytime soon.

How important is your interest in the end product when picking a new role?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ntsf46/how_important_is_your_interest_in_the_end_product/,[],1.0,1623033617.0,"Right now I'm juggling two positions where one pays better (15k more anually), looks cushy, and is totally remote, although it's for an insurance company and I am not excited about insurance. Alternatively, I'm looking at a position that doesn't pay as well, looks more demanding, is not remote, but looks like they work on exciting projects (it's a product development company that builds gadgets and gizmos). It seems it would have good variety and the projects in their portfolio look pretty neat.

Part of me does feel one job looks more exciting than the other, but I also value quality of life at my age and know that at the end of the day, writing software is writing software regardless of what it's for and there are loads of unique and satisfying challenges to be had in all at-scale applications.

I know I have a lot of things to weigh between these two positions, but how heavily do you weigh interest in the end product in your job hunt?"

Junior Developer here. How can i overcome the struggles in the industry?,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ntdkkt/junior_developer_here_how_can_i_overcome_the/,[],0.87,1622982735.0,"Hello guys,

I have struggles in my first year as a junior Full Stack Developer. I am assigned on a project with a Senior Developer (i will call it X) who has very small allocation on this project with me (mainly tasks for him are on other project(s)).

Some days are good, some days are bad. I make mistakes, I apologize, and always try learning from X. 

Most questions or problems are discussed in chat, rarely on a zoom/skype call. Since X has (I believe) little time, it takes my fix for a certain bug and review it, rewritting the parts where I haven't choose a good approach. 

After the review(verification) ends, X gives the fix back to me to test it, and ask if I have questions about the code.

The problem is that always the tasks are new for me. I do a lot of research on my own, without many questions because X has no time. When I come to a solution, X questions me back, and say to me that he found a better solution, and thinks that I did not documenting myself (X wants me to search on internet, which I did, but learning alone is very hard). 

I am asking for advices. How can I document better? How can i come with better solutions? Do I want too much from me, knowing my position where I am? I know that I am a junior and I am supposed to make mistakes, but i feel ashamed.

I asked X recently about how can I improve and about my performance, but I got no answers. Maybe X knows that I am learning, since doesn't want answers immediately and wants me to search before I bring a solution, but I am just assuming. What do you guys think?

Thank you!"

I hope that even in a post pandemic world I will be able to work remote and have some job security even if I need to find another position. Is this realistic?

Also, what is the interview process like? Do most still do white board stuff or give you an assignment to assess your skills? Or do a lot of places not do that if you have enough experience and public projects under your belt and just do a regular interview? Does it take any longer?"

I'm exhausting all my options so hoped for some feedback here. Also sorry I'm on mobile so I might have a few typos.

I recently transitioned into a formal Engineering Manager role, which is something I want and I've been seeking for the better part of 18 months. I started at a new company that has an amazing culture and flat structure, terrific benefits, and a career track and mentorship program. Really it's my dream job.

After getting hired and starting I met the team I would be managing - and it has been awful. The tone and interactions from the team overall give me the impression that I am not welcome. There were a few who were considering the open position before I was offered it, so I'm assuming at some level there's resentment from the git go.

At first I thought this was fine, nothing I couldn't handle and honestly I want to do my best. Nothing I've been doing however seems to have any positive impacts. 1:1 are unconstructive, suggestions for process improvement is heavily criticized and combated, and several times I've been given updates on the work being done one day that completely changes another (meaning, not changes but lies). I'm not getting anything constructive when I ask what I can do for the team, for each member, or to help. And when I do what I consider my job (like following up on work per a stakeholder request) I end up dealing with hostility or a tantrum.

Its been almost 8 weeks and I'm miserable. The leadership team is great, and I've been seeking their feedback and keeping them in the loop. But without their complete support and the option to remove the most toxic of the team I'm really at a loss. The engineers are very talented, and the risk of losing them will significantly impact the company.

So here I am, the FNG, complaining about a team I'm supposed to advocate for and mentor. I feel like a failure at worst, and naive at best. I came into this with different expectations but the reality is that I'm putting up with a level of bullshit that I was not prepared for.

I'm about to lay this out again with my supervisor, with the addendum that I don't think this is working out. I've already started to massively apply to anything so I have an exit strategy. Am I being too hasty? Has anyone ever stepped into this situation before? I've been in software development for 15 years and I have never had an experience that has come close to this.

Anyways, please give me the benefit of the doubt if I worded something strange and I apologize if I'm not clear. I am truly regretful that this is the best I can do to handle this situation. And I am grateful for any suggestions or feedback here.

-edit-

Really, thank you for the discussion here everyone.  Lots to reflect on for sure and this feedback has been helpful.

Something that was mentioned, and I can't disagree with, is that this is from my perspective only.  It's definitely possible that I'm not being empathetic enough here and looking at it from their perspective.  They are _great_ engineers.  They have tremendous domain knowledge and talent, and definitely get work done.  That said, this might just boil down to chemistry.  I _really_ want to kick ass at this.  I thought I was ready, but I may be harder on myself than I should be."

I have a strong foundation in technology. My career has mostly been spent working with industrial automation technologies, which has quite a bit of programming (no standard languages you've heard of). This has also involved a lot of IT work (setting up servers, networks, domains, etc.).

I also have strong writing/ people skills. I have worked as a lead project manager, driving medium-large projects, engaging with stakeholders, etc.

I'm also entrepreneurial - I've been building an online violin educational platform with my roommate the past year. We will be releasing it in the next 1-2 months. I had to learn a million new skills, and we're poised to literally change the landscape of online violin education.

All in all, I feel like a pretty decent and ""unique"" candidate."

Are there any cities in the world UK citizens can move to with a decent job scene, where I might be able to get hired or do a codecamp and then get hired? I don't care about low salaries at all and I'm happy living in developing countries. I'd really like to be somewhere cheap, sunny, interesting and preferably with a beach."
Why is it considered 'bad' to not be interested in leveling up?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ntohdw/why_is_it_considered_bad_to_not_be_interested_in/,[],0.44,1623022770.0,"I get the strong impression that it is a red flag if a developer isn't actively trying to get promoted to the next software dev level. I am not at all interested in that though, but I don't get why that is 'bad'. I want someone else to define the stories. I want people above me to exist so I can ask clarification questions. Even if I was over qualified for my current level, or more qualified than most in the level above mine, I still wouldn't want their responsibility/stress. 

The problem with higher software dev levels is you have to care more about the org's goals. That's bad. I don't want to care about their shit. It is bad enough already that I have to devote a large chunk of my life to some other company's/person's goals, as opposed to working on my own long-term goals. I certainly don't want to carve out the larger chunks of my time that would be needed to keep up with the increased responsibilities associated with the higher dev levels.

The sentiment goes back to the concept that it is stupid to work for someone, and you should only do it because you have to. The smartest thing to be doing is setting long term goals that have a high chance of making you happy, like retiring early, traveling, etc. When you work for someone, you are putting progress on your goals on pause, and helping some random rich people with their goals instead. That's seems dumb to me. 

People that don't know what to do with their time if they weren't working are the worst! Wake up! You've been doing dumb shit for other people so long that you don't even have your own hobbies or interests! /end rant"

My project has around 60. I like my job but the company has made huge strategic goals changes which I simply disagree with.

We’re located in 2nd world country in Europe and one of the best things about this company when I was joining was that they invested in local developers and QAs. We had like 200 employees. Now, the way we do work is really demanding in the company and there has been a lot of bad rumours about it so nobody wants to join and we were simply missing personnel.

Instead of working on a company image and promoting a healthy culture, the management decided they would start hiring freelancer from abroad. Sort of transition to a “worldwide” company. 

Initially it sounded interesting and I was happy to be a part of this, but what actually happened was that they put the local market in the background. Meaning they don’t even TRY to hire locally, they just go to Upwork and hire a random developer - and most of these devs simply quit after half a year for a better gig. As a lead I’m now constantly rotating people and we’ve never had a steady couple of months. I can’t build a team to work on the project, and it’s extremely exhausting to do knowledge transfers every other month.

Worst thing about this is that my management doesn’t care. I’ve said hundreds of times this isn’t working but they’re simply like “well if you need a dev we’ll get you one in couple of days”. It’s not about a developer for me, it’s about the team.

Furthermore, they’re playing number games. Since they figured out they now have an unlimited pool of resources, they’re just throwing people at the projects to try and increase the revenue which ironically isn’t happening. The company grew from 200 to 500 in three years, and the revenue grew like 10-20%. 

All in all, I once went to work to meet and have fun with my colleagues and try to create a sustainable team around them. Nowadays, I just come to work to outsource tasks to random developers from 2nd and 3rd world countries who’ll leave the company in couple of months.

Anyway, say what you want about this. It has its good and bad things, but I simply dislike it. I like the job I’m doing but I don’t like the route company’s headed. 

Since I obviously can’t change it, should I try and make “the best out of it” or start searching for other jobs… I was never in this situation so it’s pretty strange for me."

Like the millions who have been shoveled the new gold rush of life that is becoming someone who works in the tech field or as a computer programmer/software engineer, I too have come to a serious life cross road that I would love to have some real advice on what to do.

I am a Senior Accountant that had a 3 year stint as an auditor at the Big 4 and now working for a small private equity firm as a senior accountant for the last 2.5 years. I have been attempting to get my CPA license, for the past year and a half, but its been so difficult to give a shit about it anymore because the payoff is so minimal in getting it. I am making 90K now plus a bonus of about 10-12K, which is relatively okay money for Philly where I live. However, I have hit a ceiling in earnings at the senior level, and to become a manager is just not worth the headache for 10-15K more at best with the additional hours and bullshit involved.

Going back to the whole studying for the CPA, that license is now just your typical check the box and it legit doesn't even help much with salary. Companies want people with their CPA to take over the entire accounting function (ie. 12+ hour days) to only pay the same at absolute best 90K when I was dabbling in interviews throughout the pandemic. I even interviewed with a couple SF companies for remote positions that were offering that and I was saying I am making that amount in Philly, which I actually own a house here. It feels like a barrage of punches hearing about the money software people make straight out of college so I feel like I need to do something about my own career at this point.

I ideally wanted to find a way to marry the world of accounting/finance with software/coding, but it doesn't need to go down that road. What sort of path or recommendations would any of you have for me? I know SQL, and other sort of data analytics have that cross function, but if the future is in software dev then I rather put my efforts for that.

Again, I appreciate any insights."

Are there any benefits to same-level hops between large companies? How are such offers negotiated?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ntcl0a/are_there_any_benefits_to_samelevel_hops_between/,[],1.0,1622979154.0," 

I've been a senior engineer at major tech mega-corp for quite a few years. I often get pinged by recruiters and managers at similar companies to interview for roles at what is essentially an equivalent level (i.e., not ""staff""/""principal""/etc.). I'm trying to decide whether there's any benefit to trying a different company without a level change.

A lot of people move from to smaller companies and especially to  pre-IPO, and then there's the added impact, equity opportunity, etc. Smaller companies also have more flexible levels.

If a move to another mega-corp includes a level-up, then there's all the benefits of skipping a painful promotion process at your original company.

But what happens when it's essentially the same level? I was under the impression that the largest players have fairly strict comp bands within each level and that they're likely about the same. Moving companies carries various penalties (e.g, vacation accrual, tech stack changes, etc.).

So, is there a point in making these sorts of moves? Is there ever a major comp jump? What's the best strategy for negotiating such offers?"

I started learning programming on my own when I  was in high school, by the time I was about to enter university, I  already had knowledge necessary to start working as a full stack  developer, I gave it a shot and, well after one month I started working  as one, this was basically happening at the same time as university's  first semester. Since then I had been on and off with university, sure I  did not know all these algorithms and stuff back then, but it was  easier for me to learn + I kind of valued my job more.

Since  then its been two years, I am about to finish second year in my  university, but it has been so so bad experience working + studying for  uni. Main reason why is that, I kind of put a lot of effort into my  career, after two years of working, I am already on Middle position and  my project manager, team lead and CTO, all are telling me to take Senior  assessment in the same company, because currently I am technically  already doing Senior's work and they'd like to make it official. Because  of these reasons I am planning to stop my student's status, as I really  can not balance work and university, I also have a passion for game  development and I also have other hobbies (like drawing, hanging out  with friends, etc.).

One  thing is that before I actually get into game development I want to be  financially stable, and for that I wanted to one day move into big  companies, like Amazon, Google for example.

However I am really interested in what the future prospects are? How does the software development field compare to the data field? 



Some say the data field is gold for the future while others say that its a gimmick.


Are there any clear hard facts about working in any of these fields now and in the future? In terms of salary, job openings and career opportunities?"
Would I pass a background check with the University of London online bachelor degree offered via Coursera?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ntbz3v/would_i_pass_a_background_check_with_the/,[],1.0,1622976987.0,"I am asking whether that degree is legitimate here in the US.

* Does anyone have an experience whether as a:

1. Student looking for internships in the US?
2. Recruiter hiring someone who earned their bachelor from there?
3. Recent grad looking for a full-time job? Does this bachelor pass background checks?

If anyone knows of similar programs of comparable modes of teaching and tuition fees please let me know. 

**Note**: Oregon State University, Regis University, George Town University, University of Colorado, and University of Florida are not comparable when it comes to tuition fees. The cheapest one of these universities is University of Colorado at $38,200."

They were lost enough that they couldn't even think of any questions to ask. We would have to hold their hand every time, and they didn't really retain any information so they wouldn't remember the next time we asked them to do something similar. 

The worst part was they didn't have the proficiency in Python they claimed to have and didn't really know how to google things or dig into problems and find solutions. It was one of the most uncomfortable situations I've been in because they just didn't get it and I had no idea how to help them. We ended up letting them go after a few months. I'm honestly not sure how they got hired or how rigorous the interview was. 

I'm just curious how common this kind of thing is. I can see how a person might pass a basic Python coding test but still end up confused and lost like this in real situations."

Can I move on to a real dev role at a tech company with the experience I have?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nt8pz2/can_i_move_on_to_a_real_dev_role_at_a_tech/,[],0.67,1622965935.0,"I'm looking for advice about what my next career move should be. About 2 years ago I quit a high paying job working in investment banking because I was miserable. I floundered for a few months and, eventually (mostly out of desperation), took a job as a nurse aide at a nursing home. This is just about the dirtiest, lowest paying work available in the healthcare industry. I was unhappy, but pushed on - I needed the money. I picked up a hobby of software development as an escape from the awfulness. When I was coding for fun, I mostly made web apps with React and Express.

Okay, so fast forward a few months into the nursing home job and the nursing home is having crazy problems with suddenly being required to report all kinds of data associated with COVID. I was in the loop on some of these problems and happened to be talking to the NH administrator one day. I pitched him on the idea of automating all of the reporting and told him I could do it quickly and using only open source software. They gave me a shot, and I built a pretty simple automation tool in Python (which I learned as I was building this thing because I'd never used it before). It worked out really well and everyone was impressed. Now I'm there full time trying to ""innovate"" with more software. Whatever that means. 

Do I have enough experience to move on to a real developer role at a tech company? I have a bunch of web dev portfolio projects and this one professional experience, but not much else. The Python tool I've written does work, but it's more or less the equivalent of a big machine held together with duct tape and krazy glue. It's almost total shite, and as a I continue building this thing it's starting to become clear to me that I have no idea what I'm doing. I want to move on so that I can learn from someone that has more experience. Tell me what you think."
Should I tell my internship thanks but no thanks and send everything back,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ntg1mu/should_i_tell_my_internship_thanks_but_no_thanks/,[],0.25,1622992376.0,"So I took some advice from another sub and got a paid offer for an internship in web development (not something I'm interested in, in the slightest but experience is experience). Everything was going well with interviews and such until this week. 

I'm due to start this Monday and haven't received a schedule. I contacted the recruiter Thursday and he hasn't responded to me (turns out he is supposed to be my boss and make my schedule). 

I contacted HR and she referred me to the guy's email address again and to ask him. I did once again in email on Friday but it's now Sunday (3am) and still haven't heard anything. I told HR I haven't gotten a response and they haven't responded to me either. 

My family says to call it a wash and send back the company computer they gave me because it's unprofessional. My boyfriend says he's never worked a job that gave a weekly schedule until the day before (I've always been given 2 weeks out so it's new to me but possible). 

The problem is they know I'm in school and have to work around school, so I can't be given last minute random schedules. I don't know even know how many hours it is or how many days a week, etc. I was told I'd find out the week before the start date but it's been crickets. 

Plus I feel salty they haven't at least said hey sorry we are busy this week but we'll have a schedule ready Sunday instead of ghosting me. My cousin believes they replaced me and I should expect a call tomorrow saying so because she said it's not normal and highly unprofessional. 

I'm pretty convinced I'll just give it up if they contact me with a schedule because I do find it rude and unprofessional. 

However, I don't know if this is a good idea. If they give me one tomorrow, should I just tell them thank you but no thanks, or stick it out anyways? Also how would I reject it without sounding unprofessional? I don't want to seem ungrateful or rude because I did have lovely talks with them before this week and they did give me advice for certifications and classes to take.

Sorry it's so long. Tldr; paid internship supposed to start Monday, no schedule given and repeated contact has given me no response or a run around. How do I reject it if they do reach out tomorrow about still working for them?"

As I was getting done with explaining everything, approximately 25 min had passed. The interviewer seemed satisfied with the solution and he asked me if I had any questions. I asked a few work related questions, and we wrap up 30-35 min after we started. As per the interviewer, these rounds lasted 45-60 min. Two days later, I get an email saying ""unfortunately, we are going ahead with other candidates"".

How did you guys do it?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsxpwj/every_time_i_try_to_decide_on_a_career_path_i_get/,[],0.67,1622934349.0,"Context: 25, M, computer sciences student. Intern in a small Cloud Computing company doing a bit of everything from delivering mail to configuring access management in AWS. 

I need to specialize on something. It's a personal need and a company need. They left the doors wide open and I've been looking around on some different areas. 

I'm enjoying 3 fields that are radically different: Machine Learning, Security and DevOps. I can't choose and I don't have time to study all of them. 

Some background should be helpful so here it goes 

Machine Learning: personal interest but the heavy math makes me insecure bc I'm not good at it. I'm fully capacble to learn tho. My collegue is heavely relying on their students entering ML. I'm in a research group dedicated to it and I'm currently applying to a full university financed nanodegree in AWS + ML, which is great for someone like me that has experience with AWS. 

Security: I have a AWS Certification specialized in Sec. I present webinars about AWS Security and have some experience with it on job. Easy to prove my experience and I'm interested, although I would miss the development part. I'm a very detail oriented and strict rule follower so it matches some of my personality.

DevOps: been wondering around the area for some time... I enjoy Linux but never studied DevOps before. Company has a strong and motivated DevOps team and I'd be willing to learn more.

&#x200B;

Question: how did you choose a path? How were you sure it was your ""calling""? Which path seems like the best for me and how can I start to decide?"

Advise for a 35 yr old who wants to start a career in software development,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsvpfo/advise_for_a_35_yr_old_who_wants_to_start_a/,[],0.78,1622928388.0,"Hello. I am 35 years old with 11 years of IT Service Management experience in a 3rd world country. I'll be an international student in Canada, taking a two year post degree diploma program in CS this Jan 2022.  I just want to hear from experienced software engineers here what are your practical advice for someone like me whose goals are (1) to be a solid SWE and be good at my craft and (2) hit a 100k TC the soonest despite my age. 

Based on what I read so far, here are some of the stuff I should do:

1. Learn the fundamentals of programming
2. Focus on 1 programming language and master it before moving to another one. Consider what's in demand based on my location 
3. Do personal projects that matter to me (to sharpen skills) 
4. Get paid internships
5. Expand my network, go to dev meet ups
6. Contribute to open source projects
7. Learn Data Structure and Algorithm / LC or Hackerrank (for interviews) 
8. Build a good resume, practice mock interviews (to get an interview)
9. Read books / documentations / take online courses like Udemy or Coursera

Kindly let me know what else should I add on the list. Thanks!"
How Helpful Is It to Know Somebody at a Company?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsxr20/how_helpful_is_it_to_know_somebody_at_a_company/,[],0.8,1622934439.0,I’m fresh outta college and know somebody fairly high up at a company.

Don't underestimate LinkedIn!,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsjo2a/dont_underestimate_linkedin/,[],0.82,1622882255.0,"I've been hunting for a remote job and setup my LinkedIn mostly just to throw a link in the applications and add a little bit more color to my profile. However since switching my status to 'Actively looking' and putting 'Searching for remote work only' in my summary, I've been getting non-stop messages from recruiters offering interviews for remote positions including a FANG company.  Only added caviet I found is most remote positions I found were for smaller to mid-size companies. Initially I expected I'd be taking a salary drop due to switching to a full time remote position, but also found that doesn't have to be the case. Some do offer lower salary, but there are gems out there paying highly competitive rates! So if you want a full-time remote position paying good money, definitely take the time to put yourself out there! The position I got didn't even have any leetcoding in the interview process (but most did, it was either usually leetcoding or a takehome assignment)

Just got my offer in and I'm really excited to be going full time remote and it was thanks to a LinkedIn recruiter.  The convenience of having the jobs come to you is so nice, not to say it's better than cherry picking the best companies you want to work for, but I found LinkedIn to really help cast the net a bit wider! Anyway just wanted to share my experience and excitement!"
Going into my Senior year and need some career advice regarding my co-op,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nt3txg/going_into_my_senior_year_and_need_some_career/,[],0.67,1622951445.0,"Hello thanks for taking the time to read this. I am going into my senior year this fall but this summer I'm progressing to complete my third semester of Co-op at an R&D center for an appliance company. I am grateful for the experience and my tasks included working on the software for a prototype that my department has been working on. My work consisted of coding C++ on an Arduino and Raspberry Pi to develop new functionalities for the prototype. 


However I have grown some doubts about whether taking a full time position will be beneficial to me in the long term for my career. The problems I have include:


1. The amount of people working here isn't that large (this R&D center was made around 5 or so years ago and has grown to about 5 ) and consists almost entirely of Mechanical Engineer with only one senior electrical engineer and recently hired one senior Computer Engineer and while I have been mentored a lot by them I have been devoid of some of the experiences at a work place with more software developers to discuss with. I recognize some of these good practices are still up to me to learn whether I have that guidance or not but I hope you understand where I am coming from. Also, the codebase for this project has only been worked on by previous co-ops and hasn't had many code review sessions.


2. I am still at a crossroad of whether I want to pursue a field in embedded work, regardless from what I have read online I don't think Arduino is a good embedded experience. Sorry in advance if I have misunderstood that.


Thanks again for reading this and apologies for any confusion. If anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.


Final questions. How important is your first job in terms of your long term career? Also If I don't decide to pursue any embedded work will this experience still help me get my foot in the door if I apply for an entry level position for a different field like web development?"
I'm gonna be the only employee working from home. Should I leave now or should I wait?,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsw59e/im_gonna_be_the_only_employee_working_from_home/,[],0.83,1622929772.0,"I've been working as a software developer for almost 3 years now.

Although I switched for the salary and because I was told that they follow best practices and stuff (that's partly true, and I wanted that since in my previous job nobody cared), in the near future, everyone is going to work in the office. I'm going to be the only remote employee, pretty sure about that, which bothers me a lot.

"People who started of as jack of all trades , how did your career progress?",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsne3w/people_who_started_of_as_jack_of_all_trades_how/,[],0.79,1622895288.0,"***Context***

I have been working for about 6 years as a jack of all trades guy in a small-ish tech company which is also my first job out of college . Over here I have worked on a number of different things like 

* Testing : Maintaining and upgrading testing automation based on Java, C, Python, Go  
*  Webdev : A project where  I singularly  worked on desigining  and implementing both the  front and  back end
* Devops : managing hosts which have  all tyep of operating systems flavors in local KVM hosts and AWS 
* QA for different products 
* Release management  
* Benchmark performance measurement and tuning 

Working on all of this has given me the confidence that I can work on almost anything and that I genuinely like problem solving and making things. But the issue is I have  decent breadth experience but not depth .eg: 

*  The end to end webdev project that  I worked on used PHP and vanilla JS with jquery which is not something that employers look for.
*  My AWS experience has been with launching instances through something that I wrote around CLI and not stuff like kubernetes ,etc 

All of this has given me major anxiety while applying for jobs as they seem to be searching for an AWS engineer, web dev engineer , etc 

***Questions*** 

* What was your experience as a jack of trades guy/gal ? 
* Should I pick something specific like being a cloud engineer or performance engineer and double down it on my free time? 
* Should I just follow the traditonal leetcode , DSA , etc routines and hope that the companies I am applying for don't mind my lack of specialization?"

Just quit my job to go work for a startup. Was very excited because it's being founded by people I know, I got decent equity, and it's an exciting space.

At my current employer I would become the manager of my existing team, as the team lead is leaving.  


Idk what to do.  I don't really want to become a manager just yet (want to keep improving my IC skills), and there's a good chance my equity is worth a significant amount at the startup. But idk if i'll ever get another cash offer like this in my life.

A 6 month boot camp then non stop work everyday (personal projects, resume tweaking, job applying). I will say this about boot camps... if I didn’t work my ass off on my own after the program I would be nowhere near ready, they are a good platform but not enough. 

My parents are traditionalist. We have argued for 3 years STRAIGHT, I mean yelling matches, about me finishing my degree. When I got the offer my dad said “to be honest... I didn’t think you could get a salary this high without a degree”, I didn’t feel better than him or ‘I told you so’ I just felt relieved to hear it because for once in my life my hard work has paid off. Yours can too just keep moving forward.  

Admittedly it’s a contract-to-hire position. And though I know the risk, I believe my situation is ideal. Because I’m entry level I need experience regardless and I don’t have much value to be taken advantage of like a senior dev with a family on contract work. I truly believe they just want to gauge my potential and if I have it, I’ll get hired directly under the company. I still have some anxieties about this because I am moving cross country, so if you have any thoughts let me know.

My advice to you without degrees. It is hard, I say if you’re fresh out of high school get a degree. All my classmates graduated a year to 6 months ago. So even though I did it, I’m still slightly behind them. But if you’re like me and really can’t do traditional study, know it’s no excuse to do nothing, you will have to do more. When you feel incompetent, insecure and overwhelmed, have faith in yourself and know that if you just keep trying eventually you’ll get it."
"Has anyone of you moved from being a developer to remote software product consulting for Elastic, RedHat, MongoDB, SAP, Salesforce, etc?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsymvx/has_anyone_of_you_moved_from_being_a_developer_to/,[],0.5,1622936901.0,"Hi. I am a backend developer with 7 years of experience. My primary skillset includes Java, Spring Boot having experience with Node.JS, Python, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, Elastic stack, Jenkins, Pentaho ETL, Oracle Data Integrator, etc. Currently I am considering a career move. I have 2-3 options right now, out of which one is remote consulting. The other options are just a continuation of my current profile. I am more inclined towards the consulting role for the following reasons:
- Train on a skillset thoroughly on the job and you get to know in and out of it in the initial months of training. Usually all the skills that I learn on the job for the purpose of a deliverable, there I just upskill myself enough to finish my task at hand. I don't really get to learn those skills thoroughly.
- A new skillset of client consulting which I feel is an important skill to have as you grow in your career or even if I wish to start something of my own someday.
- Exposure to different use cases/system architecture (though at high level only) when doing consulting for clients from different domains like ecommerce, banking, social media, etc. This will basically increase my breadth of different system designs.
- I feel this is a right time to explore and experiment with different profiles in the software/technology field for me. Otherwise as we grow the tendency to take risk and switch profile goes down.

The concerning part for me is that it would be a significant profile change for me. Has anyone of you moved from being a developer to remote consulting engineer for a product like Cisco, Salesforce, MongoDB, RedHat, Elastic, etc. What does the future look like once someone steps into consulting for a specific product? Also, since I'll be consulting for a single product rather than doing general tech consulting, I am afraid my scope of work/expertise will get limited with time. 

The other roles offer me basically an extension of my current role and a good safe zone to continue my growth in current profile. Any suggestion would be very helpful."
From Economics to CS,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsu78x/from_economics_to_cs/,[],0.6,1622923196.0,"Redditors,

There probably have been dozens of posts similar to mine but have not seen any recently. I am a current economics and finance student in the UK, starting my final year this autumn. Over my years in uni I became increasingly interested in CS, more particularly machine learning; to get more into the field, I tried to take relevant modules ( from ML itself to Applied Econometrics, to get my hands on data analysis). I am now planing my after-uni life, I, therefore, had a few questions for you:

1) What would be good qualifications and skills to get over the year for me to change from one field to another? I have started to learn coding online last year, but not sure whether it is the best thing to do. What are some other things I should work on? 

2) I am thinking of applying for a master's, but the issue that is coming from Economics, I barely/do not meet the module requirements. Should I even bother applying for Machine Learning and CS Masters, given that my qualifications could be insufficient? Would master, for example, in Statistics allow me to move into the field? 

3) Would not be a better path for me to try to apply to search for a job in this field and learn by working? Said that I prolly would not be a compatible candidate without the skills, right?

Electric scooter startup vs finance startup.

Both jobs are remote.

I will get a 20% salary increase, but if I ask current company they might match it. The issue is - I just got a raise at the current company - so I would come off as greedy asking for a raise.

The scooter company tech stack is linux based, while the finance company is microsoft based. So I would also get to learn a new tech stack.

I am not unhappy at the current place - but I would like to expand my skillset. My boss is very nice to me and I have friendly co-workers.

My main worry is that the scooter company is not as ""safe"" as a finance company. It is one of the top 5 in the US. I have never ridden an electric scooter myself and I don't live in a big city to know how people feel about it.

I would appreciate any input or thoughts. Thank you!"
Industry experience vs higher education!,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsst90/industry_experience_vs_higher_education/,[],1.0,1622917690.0,"Hey guys, 

Just looking for a bit of advice. I'm a BSc graduate in Biochemistry who (as a career-transition due to Covid) has almost completed a 12-week bootcamp-style programming course that taught the fundamentals of Java and Web Development. I'm also somewhat self-taught so I have a few certificates. I don't have a degree in computer science. 

However, I'm currently in the position where I could continue onto a Masters in Software Engineering, but I've also had a job offer to start at the bottom of a tech company (as an analyst / tech support specialist) and potentially work my way up to a developer role. 

I'm curious as to what would be the best option in terms of efficiency in getting me to a Developer role the quickest between the Masters and related industry experience?

I've heard the tech industry is relatively different in that there is less weight put into formal qualifications as long as you have the necessary skill set, but I could be wrong.

Thanks in advance for the help and any additional advice for getting into a junior dev role would be hugely appreciated!"

feeling somewhat unsatisfied at my first FT job as a software dev but not sure how widespread my issue is,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsqz41/feeling_somewhat_unsatisfied_at_my_first_ft_job/,[],1.0,1622909963.0,"I graduated right before shit hit the fan with the pandemic (my last term of school ended in April 2020) but I started work much earlier than expected because my class switched to remote and became a joke of a class that I could just do after work.

anyways, its now been little over a year and I got some problems with my current job, but one of the biggest is the people in power. at my company, to a somewhat scary amount, non-technical people are allowed to have a say on technical parts of the code. This can range from something simple like just how to name an endpoint in a RESTful way to literally how the code sometimes works.

Now, its not just that non-technical folks are getting a say when they really should be told to let the technical folks (who know what the fuck they are doing) do the code correctly, there also seems to be a problem where there may be 1-3 senior devs (who because they have been with a company so long) apparently sometimes have the power to overrule a strong recommendation by lower-rung dev, even if that dev is technically correct in what they recommend.

Now, that being said, the reason this bugs me so much is because this is my first FT job. I have had 3 ""dev"" co-ops before this but they were all absolute waste of my time for a range of reasons from 1 mentor gave me anxiety attacks when I did not understand something in half a second to a manager who did not seem to understand that he had to give me work in order for me to do work. Needless to say, my co-ops gave me a pay cheque but very little coding experience. and now, with this FT job, I feel like I am not learning the best way to do things from my colleagues because it seems more important to make shit work in a bad way just because that's how its always been done.

So, rant aside, what I want to know is, is this typical of the dev world? Is it typical that most workplaces, its seniority that matters when options are discussed for how to do a thing rather than what approach is best practice? I know I will mostly get anecdotal evidence but I don't know anywhere else that's better to ask."

Should I take a job at a company with a highly wrapped code base?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nso6j8/should_i_take_a_job_at_a_company_with_a_highly/,[],1.0,1622898295.0,"I'm considering returning to work for a large tech company that I interned with previously, however I'm worried that I won't be learning any standard/transferrable technologies.

The company's backend is extremely wrapped and backend development mainly consist of writing Java to use their internal libraries. Their front end development is basically just drag and drop using internal technologies the company has developed or a proprietary React-like library the company developed. During my internship I talked to managers and employees - some said they wouldn't recommend new grads starting here for those previously mentioned reasons while others said that it would be a good environment to experience the full SDLC and learn design principles. (One entry level engineer even mentioned that her senior level mentor would gather up the younger developers and try to teach them how similar features are actually implemented in most other companies).

I've talked to others in the industry that say every large tech company is like that and has huge amounts of abstraction and wrapping since its necessary to maintain control and standardization. I do feel extremely grateful to have a job, but I'm just worried that the only technical skill I can say I gained experienced with in this position is Java and that my future employment opportunities will be limited -- but I'm not sure if my worries are valid. Would it be better for me to continue looking for other employment opportunities that use more widely used technologies instead?"
How should a company handle asking for lots of overtime?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nslu5w/how_should_a_company_handle_asking_for_lots_of/,[],1.0,1622889717.0,"EDIT: A lot of comments here are pointing out how this need for overtime is a failure on my company's part, and how I just shouldn't be working the overtime.
These are both fair points, however, what I'm interested in understanding is if a company does reach this point, has anyone seen any *short term* solutions that have worked for rewarding devs like myself.  Someone mentioned receiving lieu time, I have actually gotten that in the past, but as someone else stated, it never got close to adding up to the overtime I had to work. If the answer ultimately is ""there is really no feasible solution here, just fix the problem creating the overtime"", so be it.

Working at a small company for 4.5 years, we recently just got acquired so management and structure is being decided and flipped.

During this we have a project of ours blow up where we MUST meet X deadline by Y date to keep some important client. The following things suddenly happen over the past 2 weeks:


- Project managers start setting deadlines for work without even consulting us for feasibility or needed time simply because it *must* be done by that date.
- Start grabbing other devs and saying ""whatever your other projects are, are now on pause, we need you to do this NOW"". 
- Us devs who are used to taking slightly under avg pay to work cozy 40 hour weeks are now thrust into unpredictable and high stress 70 hr-80hr weeks.

Whether the dead lines really HAD to happen now, or whether the other projects were less important, not really my concern at the moment. My biggest concern is how it feels like all these demands are happening directly from project manager to me, with no other visibility or acknowledgement elsewhere. I'm willing to do crazy hours if it's that important, but I want to feel like I am going to get something for it, that it isn't just silently being demanded from me for nothing.

My question: how do other companies handle asking for unusually heavy overtime? Does any place you know of have a system that feels like it rewards or acknowledges this sort of work? I think upper management would actually be open to suggestions if I approached them with a reasonable one.

Appreciate your insight!"

Leads: how have you handled anxious junior developers?,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsehk9/leads_how_have_you_handled_anxious_junior/,[],0.78,1622866793.0,"So I've been a lead engineer for several years now. I think I'm pretty good at it but of course I'm not perfect. I've coached a bunch of juniors over this time and helped people ramp up and contribute code very quickly and learn about best practices and such. All that said, I've had several junior and midlevel engineers over this time who have really tested my patience. They've all been different, but usually what connects them is they have some anxiety-driven behavior that really disrupts the workflow of the group and wastes other people's time.

&#x200B;

One example: I have a perfectly nice coworker who is productive and generally does good work, but he has some anxiety thing going on that drives him to try to help far too much. He often tries to offer input and get involved in many situations where he just doesn't have anything to contribute, even responding on behalf of other developers in their PRs when he doesn't actually know the answer. Usually this results in team members (especially non-technical ones like Product Owners) getting very confused and time being wasted explaining why his comments are wrong and what the actual answer is. Sometimes this manifests in even worse ways, where he interrupts people in meetings to offer information but he's not even talking about the right thing. Reading this over it might sounds like this comes from a toxic know-it-all type person but really he was driven by this compulsive need to help without stopping to think if he was contributing anything useful. I'll admit that many of his comments aren't too impactful and don't waste much time, but it really adds up when he comments on work he isn't involved in multiple times a day.

&#x200B;

Another example: I had a junior developer on my team that was very capable but rushed through everything. I believe he had some anxiety about delivering work quickly and as a result he didn't care about code quality at all. One thing that repeatedly came up with him was that he was in such a rush he didn't bother fully reading and understanding PR comments or even Slack messages before beginning work based on the comments. This would waste everyone's time because we'd have to leave the same PR comments again that he didn't actually address, or repeat the same things over Slack that he didn't read the first 1-4 times. I encountered this with him several times with PR reviews and he eventually confessed to me that he never fully read my PR comments, and once he did he understood them completely. I won't lie, this really frustrated me and I was really starting to lose my patience with this guy. He seemed perfectly content to waste my time asking for repeated explanations when he had no intention of reading them. Fortunately this developer has since moved on from my company so I no longer have to deal with this.

&#x200B;

I'm curious about what other leads have encountered and how have you handled it. Usually I'm just very direct with these juniors about what I think they need to improve or stop doing, and I emphasize what the result of their actions is for themselves and for other team members. But as their behavior is very anxiety-driven it's almost as if they can't really help themselves, so they rarely make improvements."
Coworker is taking Ritalin because of large workload by company.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsovrm/coworker_is_taking_ritalin_because_of_large/,[],0.5,1622901035.0,"I found out that (at least) one of my coworkers (a fellow engineer) has been abusing Ritalin in order to keep up with the huge workload that our company has set forth on our team recently.

I don't really care if people do drugs based on personal choice or recreation, but if the context of abusing drugs is because of corporate overwork, then I consider this extremely dangerous and not a personal choice, but a decision of duress. People shouldn't have to engage in that behavior unless they want to (or have to by a prescription), not because they have to due to a company piling on more work. I don't want to see this coworker be burned out of face negative consequences of their actions, physically or mentally.

I want to inform my manager of this behavior **without naming names or indicating who it is** *(I don't want this person to get in trouble, although they wouldn't anyway)***.** I want to make sure that the manager is aware that there's drug abuse solely because of corporate ~~policy~~ assigned workload

So I'm interning at this big name bank, let's call it C, this summer. This bank sends me some lenova laptop from 2014 earlier this week and it's mandatory for us to work on this tiny laptop (my current laptop is so much better but I am not allowed to work on it)
I decided to buy a monitor+keyboard+mouse for this laptop bc I'm not used to working on such a small screen and just make sure I'm doing my best at this internship.
I'm added to some of the other interns on social media and one of them just posted stories of getting a whole ass set up? Like laptop+keyboard+mouse the whole deal that I'm spending money on

Idk i feel a bit salty about this....i know it's petty
Should i possibly email them about this?

ALSO SIDE NOTE: I don't come from a well off family, I'm on like substantial aid, that's why spending money for me on things I didn't have to bothers me so much."
Considering a Full Stack -> Mobile switch for sanity,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ns8xzb/considering_a_full_stack_mobile_switch_for_sanity/,[],0.89,1622852283.0,"So as the title says, I'm a full stack developer with 5 YoE that has grown tired of the constant need to switch contexts. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind learning and all but I feel like, unless you're a super intelligent or super passionate person, it's very hard to be a good full stack dev and I don't like the feeling of being mediocre at something I do 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. If I focus on the backend and put my effort there then I feel like I'm falling behind on the front end and vice versa. It's difficult to go deep into a particular subject because there is so much to learn and very little time (I'm talking about learning at work) so it feels like I know a bit of this and a bit of that but I'm a master of nothing in particular. I'm also not particularly interested in systems design - I'm mentioning it because that's also one thing I think I could potentially avoid being a mobile dev. I could be wrong, correct me if I am.

So yeah, I've been thinking lately what I could change and I'm considering giving mobile development a try. But I'd like to first ask people that actually are mobile developers if my idea of it is correct. I'm looking for an environment that is more standardized and where there aren't a million ways to do one thing. Where there aren't a billion libraries that do the same thing but in a slightly different way. Where you don't have to learn about noSQL databases then relational databases, microservices architecture, monoliths, queues and don't even get me started with the stuff that goes on on the front end. 

Is life simpler as a mobile dev? Which of the two platforms is better considering all of that? It seems to me that would be iOS but maybe you have other opinions? 

Or am I just romanticizing things? What are the ugly sides of mobile development that I may be not aware of? I know there's less job offers in general but there still seem to be plenty of them. I don't think mobile is going anywhere as well, it should still have a good decade left at the very least I think?

Thanks for any input!"
SF startup vs Austin Huge Company,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsbapt/sf_startup_vs_austin_huge_company/,[],0.75,1622858389.0,"Wanted advice between two companies:
Austin:
- Really big established company
- Ok salary (65k)
- Typical big company stuff (slow HR, hand holding, etc.)
- Already signed job and lease (lol)
- ~~Don't know team assignment yet so I don't know what I'll be doing, but there are some teams that look great~~
- Team assignment is...really good actually. In an area I want to work in, also small team

SF:
- Starts remote
- Nearly double salary (120k)
- Wants me to move, 6 mos in (willing to work with me)
- Exciting product (ML data space)
- Very young, I'd be in first 5 employees
- 2.5 mil seed
- Equity

Advice? This is first job out of college. I don't have a clue about how much the cost of living adjustment would be (internet said 2.25x which seems a bit high), startup life (I love programming and I am very competent), etc.

Should also add, what are the resume stipulations? On one hand I've heard that recruiters only like names they recognize, others say that if you show a lot of work done at a startup it looks better. I've also seen job descriptions that say they prefer people who've worked in a software sector company rather than at some department in a big company."

Throughout my college time most of what we did was lectures and knowing what things mean and we didn’t really do a lot of hands on so I find myself struggling with the hands on portions.

Is there anything you guys can recommend that I can sign up for or even buy as far as some good hands on classes with python and Java since I enjoy those languages the most. Also any tips you can share to make the transition into a company would be appreciated. 

Right now I bought two courses from Udemy the ones for python and Java but if you guys know some really good ones I’m open to them. Thank you!"
SWE vs Offer For Much Better SRE Job?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsdmxz/swe_vs_offer_for_much_better_sre_job/,[],0.6,1622864577.0,"So I've been working as a SWE for a little over 2 years and I recently was contacted by a recruiter at a company known to be one of the best places to work at in my city. I took the interview, and have since been interviewing being told it was for a full stack role but in the last email from them it seems like they're interested in placing me as an SRE on the infra team. The job itself is L3 and will pay somewhere between 80k-100k CAD, and I currently only make 65k CAD, so it'll be a big step up (if I get an offer from them). 

My concern is stories I've heard about it being difficult to transfer back from SRE to SWE, and things along those lines. As far as what I prefer between the two, while its hard for me to tell having not been in an SRE role, I have enjoyed the DevOpsy type work I've done on my own and professionally, and in general love playing around with Linux. On the other hand, while I love building software from scratch, I find the vast majority of programming I get to do other than bugfixing is all making tweaks to things, and building within already well defined codebases and having to write new features etc. within the framework of code that's already written, which doesn't satisfy me as much, as I like the creative process of writing code and structuring it nicely above all else.

All this being said, should I take the position? Or should I hold out for a better offer for a dedicated development role?"

Is it worth taking this as my first internship?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsjfxd/is_it_worth_taking_this_as_my_first_internship/,[],0.33,1622881460.0,"So I am a third year CS major and got my first interview for a small printing company to help the owner maintain their code for an ordering form using Javascript. The interview was very simple; he sat me down and showed me the code. The code is written and hosted using a third party site. From what I saw, it was written in a text box in plain text on the same website. I do not believe there are any backups. 

My worries are 1. The code looks like a headache to try to maintain and I am worried that there are no backups. 2. I would like to try to innovate his website using the MERN stack (I built my own personal project website using this stack) but I don't think he would be open to let me try. 3. He wants someone who can work there until graduation (I would not do that even if I had the job but it adds to the baggage). 4. I am a third year without an internship so time is getting tight 5. He was not prepared for the interview at all (didn't let me explain what was on my resume or talk about myself and he admitted to not looking at my resume).

I don't want my pride to get in the way of me taking the job because I didn't like how he didn't let me express myself during the interview but the job looks so unorthodox in terms of coding practices that I think even if I took the job for 3 months I wouldn't be able to talk about it for long if I put it on my resume. But I also don't want to miss being able to have it on my resume since I know how hard jobs are to get. My alternative is probably to make another MERN type website for my summer project and maybe learn a new framework. The job is 8-16 hours a week at a little above minimum wage but I have to commute. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks guys!"

this whole ‘coding is for anyone’, ‘everyone should learn how to code’ mantra?

Making it seem as if everyone should be in a CS career? It pays well and it is ‘easy’, that is how all bootcamps advertise. After a while ago, I realised just how fake and toxic it is. Making it seem that if someone finds troubles with it, you have a problem cause ‘everyone can do it’. Now celebrities endorse that learning how to code should be mandatory. As if you learn it, suddenly you become smarter, as if you do anything else you will not be so smart and logical.

It makes me want to punch something will all these pushes and dreams that this is it for you, the only way to be rich. Guess what? You can be rich by pursuing something else too. 

Seeing ex-colleagues from highschool hating everything about coding because they were forced to do something they do not feel any attraction whatsoever, just because it was mandatory in school makes me sad.

Bootcamp grad who just accepted an offer 6 weeks post graduation. Happy to answer questions for anyone looking for honest info about the experience.,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsabqe/bootcamp_grad_who_just_accepted_an_offer_6_weeks/,[],0.56,1622855807.0,"I wanted to post this because when I was deciding whether to go to a bootcamp or not I felt like there either weren’t a lot of posts from people who actually attended and graduated (lots from folks deciding or just getting accepted) and that generally people were against bootcamp in favor of self learning. I was in that same boat and decided to go for it and wanted to share my experience. Feel free to ask any questions! 

Below is just some context about my journey - definitely not required reading. 

My background
My background prior to enrolling in the bootcamp was an undergrad degree in poli-sci and a single intro to CS class in python. Post college I spent a couple years doing code academy classes in python, html, css, and sql (MySQL I think) but honestly I didn’t know what to do with anything I was learning and there were huge gaps in between where I would forget everything I’d learned and have to start over. 

I’d considered bootcamp in the past but the price tag ~20k price tag was scary since I had a lot of student debt already and no financial safety net. COVID is what ultimately pushed me into committing though since I was working as a Digital Marketer for a brewery and the lack of job security became too much. 


Deciding on a program
I did so much research but still found it very difficult to decide on a program since prior to being a SWE or full stack developer it’s hard to understand what each program is trying to do. Obviously this is different for everyone but for me the most important factors were a JavaScript stack, scholarship options or tuition deferment until after graduation and reputation/competitiveness. 

Also don’t let the reviews fool you - like many places bootcamps are great at flooding their reviews with 5 star ratings and hiding the negative ones. In fact after I started my program I went back to the reviews and really started digging. That’s when I found that all of the negative reviews were about 20 pages deep, much further than I would have ever ventured. I would honestly trust alumni for honest answers far more than reviews. 

The program
Don’t be fooled. The programs will claim to get you from 0 to SWE in 3 months. Expect a 6 - 12 months minimum. The program I attended had. 4-6 week prep followed by a month long precourse program after you are accepted followed by the 13 week program duration where they flat out state that job search is typically a 3 - 6 month process. I only had about 5 months of savings when I started so I barely made it work.

As far as difficulty and stress it’s honestly what you’d expect. 60 hour work weeks, 6 days per week and the amount of time you can put in outside of class time is very dependent. For me the hardest part wasn’t the material itself but the isolation from friends and family since you have very little free time, are usually exhausted at the end of the day and are going through something that they probably won’t understand. Be sure you set the right expectations with people since the program will truly demand almost 100% of you. 

Job Search 
A good program will have a solid job search department. I found the resources they provided very helpful and I structured my search by splitting my efforts into outreach (with people in my network and just random alum on LinkedIn) and cold applications. This might be a cardinal sin to say here but I honestly gave up doing leetcode and algorithms about 3 weeks into job searching. Despite all my practice none of the information ever sank in and I always did poorly on algo coding challenges. It felt like so much work for the off chance that I would get a problem I’d already done and since other places were offering me application based challenges I decided I’d rather just work for a place that didn’t judge the quality of their developers solely on algorithm knowledge. 

The most effective tool to getting interviews for me was random recruiters on LinkedIn. Some were obvious scams or under the line of legitimacy, but a solid 60% were legit and led to interviews (and eventually 2 offers). I noticed a lot of recruiters who were contacting me for senior level positions and I don’t know how common that is but I always responded that given my current experience I thought I’d be a better fit for junior - mid level roles and that usually still got me in the door for more appropriate positions. 

Offers
I ultimately ended up with 3 offers on the same day. These were for Boston based companies with base salary ranging from 80-85k with comp ranging from 15-25k. I had to do some real soul searching about which company to choose but decided that my ultimate goal was to have a good work/life balance and chose the place I felt would best give me that.

I got a software developer position that I'm not qualified for.,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nscu27/i_got_a_software_developer_position_that_im_not/,[],0.63,1622862521.0,"I'm a computer engineering major, just graduated. Basically I got a software developer job at a company I interned for in the past. When i was an intern i did nothing related to code, I mostly helped gathering requirements for a project. they loved me and told me to come back in the future for a job. I saw that they had an opening for software developer and figured I'd apply even tho I didn't feel qualified. I've never been very good at programming and always needed help with my projects, but i figured I should let the company decide whether or not I'm qualified instead of just not applying at all. The behavioral interviews went great, I'm a great communicator and I love talking to people. I kind exaggerated how I like programming, which isn't a total lie because I do like it but I just haven't practiced enough to be very good and i feel like I haven't proven to myself that I could be a real programmer yet. Anyways they moved me onto the second wave of interviews(the technical interview), and basically only asked me about the firmware projects on my resume, which of course was easy to explain because I already did them. These were school projects which involved a lot of outside help and were often group projects. during the interview I made it clear that I did not know any of the languages that were in the job description but a week later I got a call and they told me I had the job!!

I accepted it and was super excited but now that I've started I'm terrified that I could be fired for not being a good enough programmer. Managers said i could learn on the job but omg what if i can't learn fast enough? AHHHH advice please. kinda sorta panicking."

Advice for a Sales-Engineer looking to do Software Engineering,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsggc5/advice_for_a_salesengineer_looking_to_do_software/,[],1.0,1622872172.0,"I graduated with a BA in Computer Science from a top public US University two years ago and took a job as a Solutions Architect with a large, older tech company (think Oracle, IBM, Intel, Microsoft etc.). The job is essentially to go through training focused a specific product/area of IT and then consult clients about how they can use it to better advance their Information Technology systems. I took the job because I liked the idea of interacting directly with clients, and I believed it would give me a broader work experience than a typical CS major who goes directly into a development role (which I believe it has). However, after having done it for nearly 2 years I find myself longing to go into a development role. Coding and building new technology is really what excites me about the field, and while my current job role is (according to management) considered ""technical"", in reality I am a glorified salesman. I have some reasonably substantial development projects that I worked on in college and a few that I was able to work on within my company (nothing production level, think coding up a customized demo/POC to show a client). I've also spent the past few months reviewing data structures and algorithms (Done about 100 medium/hard challenges on websites like Hackerrank and GeeksForGeeks).

Product Engineering vs. Fintech?,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ns4kc4/product_engineering_vs_fintech/,[],0.76,1622840421.0,"So I've been in talks with a SaaS company lately (decently large - 300+ employees), and because I didn't apply to a specific position but instead was contacted by one of their recruiters, it seems they want to know which department I'd be most interested in working in - either as a full stack engineer in fintech, or in product engineering. I haven't found a ton of informative information online about the practical differences between the two, although I roughly understand what fintech consists of. I'm the type of person where I like to work in the most interesting areas, and get to build things more than just make small incremental improvements, and like working on complex tasks. Basically, above all else, doing the development that's the most ""fun"", and at first glance it seems fintech seems drier in that sense, as its mostly just dealing with how money is tossed around and involves more red tape and raw business-focused programming rather than building things that have an interesting and obvious finished product.

My role has always been a varying mix of technical (architectural, writing code, planning, roadmaps), process (running meetings, helping to define ticket lifecycle), and people management (performance reviews, hiring, etc.).

Recently, I've interviewed at a few places that are looking for someone to be almost exclusively focused on the people side of things.  But I just don't understand how purely managing people can be a full time job.  In my experience, the people part of things has never required much time investment (with the exception of running hiring processes, when those are happening).  Most of the time, people are just working, and getting along, and there's not much to do.  I've also found that a lot of the people management that I've done is not easily decoupled from the technical pieces (e.g  Jim gets upset that Linda is being too picky in her code reviews; Team A is not happy with Team B's attention to bugs reported by Team A, etc).

Am I just doing it wrong?  Am I misunderstanding what these companies mean when they say they are looking for someone primarily focused on managing people?  What is it that I'm not getting?

Is It Worth Learning Web Development for Passive Income?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsdu4i/is_it_worth_learning_web_development_for_passive/,[],0.5,1622865095.0,"Hi, backend developer here. I'm a freshman at college, and I'm doing an internship at a software company.

I am curious to hear if it would be worth learning web development for the sole purpose of passive income. I would love to throw together something that generates ad revenue, or just some kind of project that can have me create more money for myself. I can only work during the summers, college is too demanding for a job, so passive income is important to me so that I can still be improving during college.

Right now I have a Youtube channel that makes me \~$10 a day passively. I don't get much gratification out of making videos anymore though. I am wondering if web development might be a better path for me to generate this income but do it in a way that actually develops me professionally and aligns closer to my interests. I know nothing about web development though, the closest I've gotten to experience with it is having to use Selenium to pull things from a website for my job.

My question is, is this realistic? Can I generate ad revenue, or create some kind of product online that could serve as income for me throughout the year? Is there a better CS-related path for me to take with the backend knowledge I already have?

Any and all input would be greatly appreciated!"

How bad is it to quit after just being retained?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nscale/how_bad_is_it_to_quit_after_just_being_retained/,[],0.5,1622861096.0,"Not including specific values to avoid being identified.

In February I tried to quit my current job at  series A startup (1.5% equity, which is virtually worthless) for an offer at another private company with no equity but for about 15% more salary + a 10% annual bonus target.

My current company counteroffered my resignation with a 30% bump over my then salary. I accepted and received a 6% bonus that I would have to pay back if I left in less than a year.

Well, my friend just referred me to a role at his series F company that just received a >$1B valuation and looks like they'll probably go public in the next two years (based on what he has told me about their revenue/expense, looks really great). The salary is 16% higher than my current, not accounting for equity, and its a title level bump. If the company IPO's at their current value, my total compensation will be closer to 50% higher than my current total compensation (there is really very little hope for current company to go public, and an acquisition would be for very little based on our revenue).

(If anyone is curious how I'm doing this, Carta has a pretty good hypothetical exit options calculator here: [https://carta.com/blog/value-equity-offer-startup-equity-calculator/](https://carta.com/blog/value-equity-offer-startup-equity-calculator/))

I'm currently interning at a startup, where initially I was in a team with me ane my old boss. He then left the company and I was the only person left on the team (I made a post about this lol)

In the end I talked to HR and they said I shouldn't worry too much as they are currently looking for a replacement and the project is actually done, just that there are minor bug fixes that needs to be done.

I have since been relocated to a different team with no specific mentor. They said I would be working like an ad-hoc and that I would help anyone that needs help

The project manager lately has been assigning me tasks with very close deadlines (usually the deadline is no more than 5 days) where I need to make a feature with existing components from different page. As I am very new to the code, I am pretty slow with work and he basically guilt tripped me into working over time, and being the dumb fuck I am I did. He said something along the lines of ""you made the decision to intern at a start up, you should know what you're doing, it's normal to work over time at startups""

If you're wondering where are the other software engineers, they are working on a long term project that completely revamps the website

So ok, I understand having to work over time to meet a deadline, as there's supposedly no other person who could tackle this task. What bothers me is that this particular supervisor keeps on assigning task with short deadlines to me and I can't keep up at this point and it has gotten so bad that for me to keep up, I would have to work ON THE WEEKENDS (even my supervisor acknowledged this fact, and he was the one who suggested it) 

This is clearly overstepping the boundaries but I don't know how to respond. I really want to approach this in a professional manner and maintain a positive relation with the people within the company. 

I appreciate any advice, thanks!"

How much is actually expected from a junior developer?,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nrm50u/how_much_is_actually_expected_from_a_junior/,[],0.89,1622778353.0,"I have about a 1.5 years of experience.

I'm on my second week and I'm not sure I can do it in three.

I've been working here for a month and I'm still trying to grasp the company specific rules/tech/logic/etc. I guess my coding challenge went so well that they built up a lot of expectations, but I worked my ass off for the challenge as I really wanted to get the job. Now that I'm here I feel like I need to continue working that hard to even try to keep up. I've even been working off hours to get to the goals that were set in our meetings...

I'm not sure what to do as I do enjoy working here but the amount of pressure I'm feeling I think is a bit disproportional to my experience. To clarify, my part of the project only comes in a bit later, so there's the buffer for my inexperience.

I just can't tell if the amount of work that was given to me was miscalculated as they thought there was a lot less to do or if I am just incompetent and some other junior dev would have been able to do this quicker.

It is not certain yet but it is not going well either. If i fail those 3 courses. I can only take those 3 course in next year Spring semester. Therefore, I have to wait like 1 year to graduate.

Usually the error causes my solution to be marked as a fail, however whenever I run my solution in my own IDE its all fine. Its because of the inputs the leetcode checker gives, im not sure how they input their values so I cant optimise my code to work with there inputs. Im not to keen on spending and wasting time on trying to optimise code for leetcode, so I basically use leetcode for the questions, but use my own separate IDE for the solution writing. Is this fine, as I don't see any difference. Also I hear interviewers let you use your own IDE anyways."

also, do you ever think of beginning a start-up or would you rather just chill at senior-level positions alternating companies every so often?

Some tips from someone who's enjoyed their job and career.,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nrt9x3/some_tips_from_someone_whos_enjoyed_their_job_and/,[],0.57,1622798586.0,"**Background**

I graduated about two years ago with a bachelors with a non-CS degree and taught myself how to write code casually over the last year of my bachelors degree. I've worked at non-tech but extremely large and prestigious institutions development. I have had a non-eventful and content career. I have never worked longer than 44 hours a week, I have never felt underpaid or unhappy about my choice in profession. I think a lot of it has to do with the luck of having a good team but I also think a part of it has to do with some of the stuff I've applied during my career.

**Lessons Learned**

* **Big-N isn't everything,** the amount of time you spend grinding out leetcode *just* to grind it out 16 hours a day at amazon isn't worth the opportunity cost of living your life and stumbling on better opportunities/happiness. My TC has been around the low six figure mark but I spend most of my time and brainpower outside of work doing stuff I enjoy. I use my normal job to pay my tax bill every year.
* **WLB and TC are not mutually exclusive**
   * There are plenty of ""unknown"" companies with amazing WLB and pay, the best thing to do is to set boundaries. Tell your hiring-manager your priorities, its good for them and good for you.
* **Never say no to learning a new skillset.**
   * I was initially hired on as a java developer but was sent to do PEGA instead, which is basically a nicer salesforce. Halfway through, I was asked to run as a support engineer for a few months, manage an actual salesforce application and then eventually back to Java.
   * It keeps you valuable, flexible and makes your job less dull. I see a lot of people complain about ""I wasn't hired to do x"", that's a terrible attitude to have, your job is to think and learn not write CRUD until retirement, it leads to the next lesson.
* **Communication skills are key**
   * One of the most important skill on any **team based environment** is your ability to socialize and communicate. I've been hired and promoted based purely on my communication skills whilst having average talent.
   * Getting along with your coworker and earning their respect is a very important thing. Unless you work at amazon, they will try and help you in anyway they can, telling my boss/interviewer that I **COLLABORATED** with another coworker for a small side project at work was critical in both my promotion and job offers. In any situation, I will always try to make my coworker look as good as I can.
   * If you're doing something unfamiliar, risking a deadline or having trouble the best way to move forward is to **tell the truth**. Your teammates will appreciate it, you'll get taught how to do something and your boss won't fire you for lying. This culture was strongly encouraged on my team and we've had one of the best deliverable and stability in our company.
   * **Phrasing is key.** I think this is where most people have trouble, I earned a business related degree and communication has always been key. I can give some examples, but it's best to really read or practice it. Example: I can't get this done on time because I'm unfamiliar with the stack/tool/environment/etc. ---> There's a risk that the current assignment I'm working on won't be finished on time due to being unfamiliar with x/y/z, can I get someone to assist me or point me in the right direction?
   * Solving leetcode won't leave a strong impression at interviews but being a sociable,""cool"" guy with a sense of humor and collaborative mindset has always been the #1 deciding factor on how I got my jobs.
* **Resigning is (almost)always an option.**
   * If you truly feel dissatisfied your job, team or whatever you can always resign. Resignations **matter** **a lot** to any reputable company. Hiring, onboarding, training costs **a lot** of money. I felt unhappy with decisions made by upper management and found a new job, it gave my other coworkers the courage to make the same decision and now there's a massive retention problem at my old place.

Need help deciding between two offers,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ns093v/need_help_deciding_between_two_offers/,[],0.5,1622824790.0,"I'm a new grad and I received two offers from companies in different states:

Offer 1:

\- Bay Area, CA

\- \~125k base, \~15k one-time bonus, option to buy \~10k worth of (private) company shares for \~10k

Offer 2:

\- Washington, D.C.

\- \~100k base, \~100k RSUs vested over 4 years, 5k one-time bonus

They are both small to mid-size companies, between 100-1000 employees I would say... I think I like the bay area a little more than dc, in terms of the types of people and the locations. According to (1), the cost of living in the bay area is \~25% higher than dc, and the tax rates are similar for my level of pay (2). I think I like the product I'd be working on in dc a little better than in the bay area, and the company in dc seems a bit better than the one in the bay area. But I'm a bit worried that working in dc will mean its harder to find another job and make connections compared to working in the bay area. 

Another thing is I talked to some of the engineers from the bay area company after receiving an offer and I liked them. But the glassdoor reviews for the bay area company are pretty bad, and the reviews for the dc company are a lot better. The glassdoor reviews for the bay area company also mention they have a good work/life balance.

I don't think how much I'm making/saving is a big deal for me... I'm more focused on how employable taking each job would make me and how much I would enjoy living at each location (making friends, etc). I should probably say this on a throw-away account but I'm also worried if I'll be able to do the job... I had an internship at a big tech company but didn't get a return offer, so maybe I should take the easier one to be safe??

Any advice or thoughts would be much appreciated.

Thanks.

Also, these offers are without negotiation... should I? And how easy is it to make friends who like doing stuff outdoors in both places?

How would I stack up as a SE,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nrzl51/how_would_i_stack_up_as_a_se/,[],0.6,1622822061.0,"I’m in the process of trying to get a software engineering job, ideally in the finance sector. My background is environmental modeling and I’ve learned to code over time. I started off using R and now use Python daily. All in all about 4-5 years of programming daily as most of the job. My issue is that I don’t know how I stack up because I work with other scientists who’ve learned to program. 

I have worked on public repos and have experience working in an agile environment. My work now involves open source geospatial data and I also have a ton of experience working with data frames and visualization. 

I’ve developed on windows/Linux machines and I’ve done some basic parallelization but haven’t used any of the libraries for big data (mostly just multiprocessing, numba, and concurrent futures). I have experience developing in conda environments and docker images/containers.

As far as other languages and full stack skills, I have very limited experience with JavaScript and C#. I’ve done some basic html work and helped on a project that used django. I’m sure I could learn these things but my exposure is limited. I also don’t have experience developing REST services or APIs but I’ve used them. I’ve used sql some but I have plenty of experience querying data some I’m not too worried about being able to get up to speed there.

I think that about covers my experience. As to the finance sector, I don’t have work experience but I’m very passionate about the subject so I want to make a career change. I recently spoke with a hiring manager at a company in SF (friend of a friend) and they said that I should be competitive and should even apply to senior engineer jobs. They did not see my code or resume though we just talked about my experience. Any thoughts would be appreciated. I want to know my weak spots so I can fix them and get into the field officially."
Are there any developers here that have experience working as a Real Estate Agent?

I'm a mid 40s professional poker player, dad to two young kids, and I reside in the Silicon Valley.   I have been wanting to break away from poker and do something different for a few years now.  That was put on hold when my father had a stroke 3 years ago.  I was his primary caretaker.  During this time, I took care of him, and played online poker whenever I had free time.  He passed away a month ago.  I feel like I need another job or at least a purpose in life now more than ever.  The two career paths I had settled on were SW dev or Real Estate Agent.  I happen to live in an area where both fields are highly prolific....lots of opportunities, and tons of competition.  I've talked to numerous people in these fields, and have a good idea of what to expect.  Both jobs seem to be suitable fits for me.  I'm a problem solver and I love ""fixing"" things, hence SW dev.  I also love meeting/helping people and closing deals, hence RE Agent.  Money is not at all the bottom line for me.  I refuse to shamelessly promote myself if I go into Real Estate.   My plan would be to inform people in my network that I am an agent, and hopefully, in time, get some referral business.  I know I will not win any awards for ""salesperson of the month,"" and I don't care.  That means nothing to me.  If I sell a couple of houses a year to start, that's fine by me.  My aim is quality, not quantity.  I have no idea, however, which career is better for me, and there's no way any one here could possibly begin to answer that.  Unfortunately.  I get that.  What I would like to know is if anyone has experience doing both!  I have yet to meet anyone that has done both.  I'd love to hear which career you prefer and why.  It might help me make a decision on which to pursue.

Many thanks

PS I have essentially no exp as a dev.  I did very basic level coding (C++) years ago, for a very short time (6 months).  If I go the dev career route, I'd being going from zero to coder, and my plan is to use the variety of online resources to get myself up to speed and hopefully employable within 6-12 months.

A CS soon-to-be senior and I don't think I'm ever going to get a job...,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nrz7f5/a_cs_soontobe_senior_and_i_dont_think_im_ever/,[],0.44,1622820423.0,"I am (21F) at the end of my 6th semester in my 4-year computer science engineering bachelor's course (with a specialization in Machine Intelligence and Data Science). I chose computer science cause I liked math and logical thinking, but in came data structures and design algorithms in my second year and I started losing my footing. I get the point of these courses, but I was so bad at them and was lost most of the time, so I just associate them with dread. The courses that I do like revolve around Data Science, obtaining insights, experimenting, that kind of stuff. I don't really enjoy Machine Intelligence but that could be because when I took that course, the online mode of classes sucked (and it needs me to understand algorithms **😐**).  I'm currently doing a course on Computer Network Security and Information Security but I don't have any feelings about that. 

These two months were reserved for internships, but I wasn't able to get any. I find the technical coding tests really hard. And I haven't landed a single interview. My CGPA is an 8.5 and I've worked on projects almost every semester, and most of the time I'd be using libraries and stuff that already exist. I'm not writing my own algorithms anytime soon. 

I'm just going to put down a list of stuff that's worrying me: 

\- I really need a job. I don't even know if I'd like it, but at least it would pay, and if I could stick with it for a few years I might have other ideas down the line and do something I actually enjoy. Which leads me to my next point: 

\- I need my resume to look good but that's so not the case. All I have on my resume right now are projects that I've done. And I don't even feel like they're any good. I haven't done any volunteering cause. Let's just say I wasn't having a great time at college, so stuff like organizing events was way out of my train. But I could feel it every single minute I wasn't doing this stuff. I don't know I wasn't in a very good headspace.

\- I feel like a lot of the stuff I know is meager and I'm not very well informed. I'm doubting my skills because of how I've performed in these technical rounds for internships (so many of them deal with data structures and algorithms and I immediately feel a dread) (I'll be honest I only started actually practicing solving coding questions like recently on leetcode but still, if I'm not even into that stuff, why do I even need to be tested for it D;)

\- I feel so burnt out and I have no motivation to even work on my remaining courses. I'm currently doing a project with a teacher and I'm sucking at it. I think I actually need to sit down and understand the nitty gritty details of an algorithm but I'm not able to concentrate at it cause lockdown again isn't helping. Nothing's been fun. And this ever looming feeling of disappointment won't go away. 

Like I understand algorithms and data structures are important. I've felt their need while doing projects. But I for the life of me can't get myself to sit down with them. I've been such a good student, but the past two semesters have sucked and I'm so scared about my exam, and this big project and not being able to score an internship. 

So I want to know if I can ever land a job with my current progress? What additional work do I need to put in? How can I even look for jobs that I love if I'm not even able to get past a technical coding round? How did y'all get anything done? I'm so confused and scared right now and the second lockdown isn't helping cause I'm at my home all day thinking about how my graph feels like it's going to drastically fall. 

I'm so sorry if I sound like a stupid brat but I honestly don't know what to do!"

I had to sit in front of 3 people reading my CV and transcript for the first time. They said remarks in a foreign language that I can understand but not speak so I had to pretend I didn't understand anything. They kept asking why I didn't take this and that and why I even bother applying.. even though they said I ""passed the document screening test"" in the interview invitation email.

Long rant, I need to get this off my chest. Going with throwaway account since I don't want my friends to know about all the details. I'm a hypersensitive person by nature, so putting up a though exterior is harder than ever. But I guess I've been mostly lucky in my past job-hunting experience, for recruiters I talked to were generally nice. If I lack something that they're looking for the most in an incoming intern, they'd tell me honestly and I'd always be like, ""cool, let me work on that, and I'll contact you again once I'm ready"".

I'm kind of desperate to find summer internships these days, so I just applied to all companies I could find. Before you say it, yes I know I should've applied to companies that I know I'd be a top candidate in, but several times I've gotten offers from companies I thought wouldn't accept me, because they saw my potential from the many cool (tho unrelated) stuff I did on my CV -- according to them.

A bit of background: my main focus is AI and data science, although I have a little experience with front-end. I'm getting interested in backend lately, since I'm taking several backend-related courses, so I'm trying my luck with backend job openings in startups in case they don't mind accepting newbies (I know it's near impossible, but why shouldn't I give it a shot anyway?).

Now I'd assume that if they invite me for an interview, they'd have at least seen my CV, known the kind of stuff I have and haven't done, and saw the slightest potential in me. I received a notice that I ""passed the document screening process"" and they would like to have me in an offline interview, with dress code: formal clothes. I asked what kind of stuff I need to prepare for the interview and they didn't reply. Cool, maybe they wanted to keep it a secret

So I came, but the first greeting I heard was that they somehow lost my CV and I needed to send them a copy again. Obviously I got confused but I did anyway, and I had to sit down in a small table facing 3 guys who are reviewing my CV while pointing out things on my CV and transcript and making remarks in a foreign language (I'm an international student). It's a very awkward situation since I'm not fluent enough to talk in their language, but I know just enough to understand what they're talking about. So they'd say things like ""that girl did this.."", ""she didn't do this at all.. wut?"" etc etc, and I just had to pretend I didn't hear anything while still keeping my cool to answer their obviously impromptu questions. And one guy would translate my English interview answers to their language, since the other guys aren't that fluent in English, so I painfully need to hear my paraphrased answers throughout the interview.

Near the end, some leader-looking guy came, he saw my CV for a few seconds, and asked why I haven't taken this course and that, and how I haven't taken so many required courses (but I'm in year 3 and I only need 2 more courses). He then asked questions that I didn't know the answer to, and when I tried to answer he would make obvious ""ehh what?"" faces and told me why I even applied if I hadn't took this and that. It was getting harder to maintain a straight face, so I went blabbering about how I'm used to study materials on my own, that there are countless free resources, and that I believe I could study on the way given enough time etc etc.

I mean I get that those stuff are important, but if it's such a problem that I haven't taken those classes, why not reject me from the first place? I've stumbled upon this kind of situation before and the recruiter would just straight up tell me to study this and that first before re-applying, instead of painfully dragging the ""why did you even apply?"" question for hours.

The offline situation made it even awkward. After making all those mean remarks the ""leader"" casually asked me how was the interview, and I just said it was kind of not what I was expecting. I didn't have time to eat before the interview, it was raining, and their office was sooo far from the main entrance. Call me a snowflake or whatever, but I'm still shook and cry when I remembered what happened. Now on top of a bruised ego, I'm losing the interview confidence I had tried so hard to build over the years.

I know I have to own it etc etc and I'm totally fine with them not accepting me for my lack of experience, but can't they do it in a nicer way?"

a few months ago as a remote dev. This is what has transpired since then:

- No onboarding, I was working on code a few hours into my shift before even being introduced to everyone. Wasn't even signed up for health insurance but they were still like ""MUSH!""
- CEO is an asshole. Yells at people in meetings. Openly hated by employees.
- No culture. People don't talk to each other at all. Everyone is cold and unfriendly.
- Mass attrition. The engineering department has lost 1/3rd of existing employees this year. They have responded by doing mass hiring but even those new people are noping out after they found out what a nightmare this place is.
- Bait and switch job. I am not doing what I interviewed for.... at ALL
- I was supposed to get RSU's but mysteriously all talks of that are gone. So I'm literally missing compensation.
- They have been throwing around the idea of moving all employees (even remote) to in office across the country next year which I won't do. So I might not even have a job come 2022.

So needless to say this place fucking sucks. But instead of stressing myself out and cranking up my anxiety, I have taken a different approach: I have not been taking this job seriously at all. 

I get up and sign on to Slack on my phone and not leave bed until an hour or more later. I never work past 5 despite others working long hours. I might do 2 hours of actual work a day. I'll get up in the middle of the work day and and disappear for awhile. 

I mean why the fuck should I care? This place has shit all over me, and I don't care if I do the same. If I get fired I'll just tell the next job I was let go because I didn't want to move across the country (which is already all over Glassdoor). If I'm not let go I plan on doing this until late this year and then I'll start leetcoding again. 

So my question is, has anyone ever done this before? What was the overall impact to your career to just dick around for awhile at a place you hate before moving on somewhere else?"

Startup illiterate - is this a decent offer?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nrxahs/startup_illiterate_is_this_a_decent_offer/,[],0.5,1622812611.0,"I have 8YOE and have only worked in big tech companies. I got an offer from a startup a few days ago and it's my first startup offer ever, so I'm not sure what's fair versus not.

Company: Pre-series A tech startup. ~30 employees, half of them being software engineers. I know they're making a decent monthly recurring revenue, but don't know details about that or the valuation just yet (have a call with them tomorrow)

These are the rest of my offer's details:

 - Base: Surprisingly the startup beats my current base salary by about 2%. So decently happy with this, as I was honestly expecting a base salary cut.

 - Equity: 130k stock options, vesting over 4 years with a 1 year cliff. Total of 100m shares. So I'd be getting 0.13%, with possibility of more ""depending on performance."" Gut feeling tells me this is low for a pre-series A, but not sure.

 - Unlimited PTO. I'm aware this is usually a trap, but speaking with the founder and current engineers it seems they honestly value and use this well.

 - Health care, 401k

I'm at a point in my life where I can take the risk of my options turning into vapor without it being devastating. No dependents and relatively young. I'm also excited about moving into a faster paced, higher impact work environment. I've been coasting at my big company for too long.

Having said that, how does the offer look in an objective sense? And anything I should definitely ask them during the call I have tomorrow?"

For example Google is pretty close to me, but statistically speaking a 32 y.o. POC like me doesn't have as good of a chance at landing a job there compared to most of my peers, even though I feel sharper now than I've ever been.

  One discouraging thing was to see that all of my peers from my study group got internships this summer but I didn't. I don't think I'm the best out there but I tutor, I'm a T.A., I have just as good grades as them (we're all around 3.7 gpa), and we have the same projects since we worked together among them. Yet I got no internship even though I filled out around 600 applications and none of them filled out more than 100. We all tailored our resumes the same way (from the same person's advice). Maybe this is coincidence, but also maybe not. Maybe they saw my LinkedIn picture and that was all... Either way I'm still really happy for them. I want all my friends to look good and succeed!
 
  I know there's a chance I'll need to work harder and preform  better than my peers for the same praise and I'm ready for that. But are there any late starters/POC here that can share some advice?"

I have been dabbling with software engineering as a front end developer since 2012 but never had the guts to pursue it all the way. I started launch school and got accepted into a bachelor's degree in software engineering starting September. However, because many universities don't offer two bachelor's, I got accepted into a second grade university. I tried going for masters but all the universities I applied to said they I don't have the necessary qualifications.

As a manufacturing engineer, I work allot of hours and get bored often at work. I don't see myself doing this for a long time and that's why I wanna make the switch. With the long hours, I'm starting to realize that it'll be very hard to study and work so I'm thinking of quitting my job and focus on studying full time. This will mean at least two years with no income and after two years starting with an income that could be substantially less than what I'm making.

What is the most optimal method of studying?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nruwqp/what_is_the_most_optimal_method_of_studying/,[],0.33,1622804068.0,"Anyone in anything software-related understands the feeling of staring down a roadmap to becoming a <SWE | Data Scientist | MLE | DE> that consists of a million different technologies that sometimes don't overlap much.  

My question is for those who are going through it, and those that have made it out on the other side... Do you guys find it more successful to ...

1. Study one topic at a time to get through it quicker and repeat with the other topics.
2. Take the college approach, studying 3-4 topics at once where you get exposed to more stuff but take longer to complete.
3. Pick one topic, maybe one that has a good amount of overlap with the rest of the topics in the roadmap, and just go as deep as possible, and lead with that during interviews.

I've been in the analytics space for some time now and would like to learn a bit more about Machine Learning.

I thought we bonded well overall and were able to generally relax and not take our work seriously all the time, talk politics and all that. But after we parted ways and move to different companies, people seemed to lose interest in keeping in touch. Only when I initiate and call for a meetup that everyone gather. However, I realized that people actually already have their own cliques from our previous conversations and their social media. But one general theme is, they stick to their clique of similar origin. My Indians friend went to hang out with their Indians friend, and my Chinese friends also hang out with their own cliques. When I reached out to them, they pretty much do not contact coworkers outside of their race anymore, there are exceptions though. But generally, my ex-Indian coworkers no longer keep in contact with my Chinese coworker, and vice versa.

**Teams**:

\- **Nvidia**: AI/CUDA/parallel programming; C++(primary) & C & Python.

\- **Tesla**: Full stack internal system development; Golang & TypeScript.

From my interview experience, what the team at Nvidia is working on seems really cool. My interviewer told me they are mainly doing some customization of GPUS/lower-level computing stuff for their clients. There are some AI works(mainly in PyTorch) but pretty limited compared to other teams. The team at Tesla on the other hand works on pretty standard dev projects, not really related to their main product, so not sure if this seems like a solid place for SDE internships (correct me if I'm wrong, this is only from my friends/professors' impressions)

My main goal of doing this internship is to learn as much as I can and boost my dev skills. But right now I'm not sure if I want to continue working in AI.

I would lose my benefits, have no PTO, and  essentially have no guarantee that I will be brought on as a Full-Time  Employee.

My solution to meeting hell at my new role (in my same company),2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nrh9a4/my_solution_to_meeting_hell_at_my_new_role_in_my/,[],0.58,1622765723.0,"I've worked five jobs in my time. The most recent is one I've been at for a total of five years. Most of the previous jobs average 1-2 years. I've seen a lot in the time I've worked. I've bounced between being an operations / security guy to developer back and forth depending on what I feel like doing at a particular job. I managed a team for about a year, too, and didn't care for that but I was good at it. I was an SRE for the first 2.5 years of this job, and am now a Principal Software Engineer. 

At my most recent (five year job) I recently changed to a new team this past January and I have to say the meetings have been excessive. 

* Daily stand up for 30 minutes with 15 people that always goes over in time at 2:30pm. 
   * worth noting that we all work on different stuff and I rarely care about what's going on in this, and they rarely ask questions about what I'm doing.
* Sprint planning weekly - Wednesdays at 3pm. 1 hour.
   * Same as above. My work isn't relevant in that they need to be groomed in the context of this meeting.
* My manager usually throws up 1-2 meetings a week at 12:30p or 1p which drives me insane. My lunch is sacred. I need that hour to myself. 
   * This is usually some ""resolve the week's misunderstanding"" meeting.
* Two alternating 1 hour meetings every Thursday. One of which has 30+ invitees. 
   * These are related to a project that I don't actively work on, but the service I'm writing will interact with. 
* Status check with product owner at 10am every T/Th on one of the two products I'm working on (writing a service from scratch) - 30 minutes.
* Weekly sync with the SRE team at 4pm on Thursdays. 1 hour. Usually releases early.
* Weekly security meeting to update on security of our products across the org. 
* Weekly sync up on yet another product that is critical - usually gets way off topic. 11am on Wednesdays - 1 hour.
* Manager wants a weekly 1 on 1. 30 minutes, and floats depending on our availability.

These are the meetings that occur fairly normally and don't include stuff like company-wide meetings I'm expected to go to, external product owners and managers wanting to meet, etc.. I found that  while I enjoy the work at this ""new role"" within the same company - I'd find I was logging on at 6am to get some work done before meeting hell roles in, and starting work again at 9:30pm when my wife goes to bed until about 11p-midnight. Sometimes even 1am. I get good work done late in the evening so this isn't a total loss for me.

After a period of my wife getting upset at my work hours, and the actual work day being a complete wash most of the time, I decided to set up some boundaries knowing full well there could be career consequences. I'm not \*too\* worried about these as I think I've garnered enough respect at this place over the years.

* Ultimate rule - any meeting with more than 4 people in it is wasting SOMEONE's time. I am declining these immediately now. Footnote is I am requesting that the person convey why I'm needed in the meeting. If I can't find a way to participate - I skip. There are exceptions, but for the most part I rarely come out of large meetings feeling better than I entered them.
* When we hit a moment where nobody has said anything for a minute, I drop. It's too easy to give people the opportunity to take things way off topic, and go over in time by asking ""so anything else anyone wants to talk about?"" - stick to the meeting agenda. When things veer off, I now leave. There are of course exceptions where I feel it's relevant to me, but 9/10 times it's not.
* Document, document, document. A common ""meeting invite"" I get, is someone asking me to explain stuff I did to them. **I am now declining meetings labeled as such and requesting the meeting requester read ALL the documentation I have written before pulling me into a meeting.** I've finally decided it's not my job to teach people who don't know how to read documentation. This was a hard one for me. I LOVE being the guy in the know, who has the answers. I just can't afford it anymore form a time perspective. These invites usually come in the form of an email invite, with a subject, and no description. Usually the subject is boilerplate: *""I heard you are working on <service> and I am interested to learn more about it""*. They usually don't even attach a zoom meeting and I end up asking them for zoom info. These are usually always the ones who are late to their own meetings too.
* I declined 3/5 of the stand ups. I go in, say my piece, and leave, since I am not super interested in the non-related projects of my other team members. I cleared this with my manager. She was cool with it.
* Sprint planning - as I mentioned I'm not super relevant to the sprint I got tagged in. I set up my own sprint planning with the relevant other 3 people. Every two weeks, not every one week. We downsized it to 45 minutes.
* **Inviting me to a meeting with no agenda - auto decline**. This is how meetings get off topic, unorganized, and unproductive. I actually went to one of our overall team meetings and explained that I'm no longer going to accept invites without an agenda. The news was mostly well received, but some people argued that ""you want to meet but urgently, and don't have time to come up with an agenda."" - I called BS on this and said that if you can think to have a meeting, you should be able to think of 3-5 bullet points and a summary of what you want to gain from meeting. If you can't do that for me, then I can't provide my time for you. Period.
* No more having the same meeting twice. This is the big killer for me. I will get invited to a meeting where a useful conversation happens, but then the same meeting gets scheduled with a slightly different permutation of invitees. **Record every useful meeting. I started putting the burden of proof on the meeting requester (for these duplicate meetings) to show me that meeting would be productive, and that all the answers they seek are not within the recording of the previous meeting. I ask that they watch the recording (send them the link of course), and create an agenda out of what** ***they want out of it.*** If they cannot provide an agenda that doesn't completely overlap with the first meeting (see previous point), I refuse to meet. I don't have time to have the same meeting multiple times. The company is not paying me to be a professor. They are paying me to produce revenue through code.

I want to close by saying I'm in a comfortable place in my life. My wife is a surgeon, and we have a nest egg that I can afford to be jobless for a hot minute. I took some risks by shaking things up with respect to meetings at my company. I also have a reputation that precedes this behavior, and I'm not sure a new employee would have been successful in declining everything and putting these hard limits in place. I will say that I feel MUCH better about my days, every day now, then I did when I was in meeting hell. I'm no longer lacking the sleep I was before, or as cranky. I don't bitch about meetings as much, and I'm actually providing quality meaningful code. With the meeting hell there was a necessity to cut corners with the limited time I had available.

PS: Some of this is definitely due to mismanagement. I have yet to find a well managed company in my time though. Every company has had its caveats. I love the company I work for and the people I work with. I am trying to make the situation sustainable for me in the long run. I can't fully recommend someone go into a new company with this mentality, and expect the same result I described. If you are in survival mode and just happy to have a job I strongly recommend not pushing the limits until you can achieve comfort with the idea of possibly not having a job.

"Would you choose to be the most senior engineer on a team, or be on a high performing team with a lot of smart people?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nrm82d/would_you_choose_to_be_the_most_senior_engineer/,[],0.6,1622778565.0,"I'm in this exact situation right now.

Unfortunately, I've only been on the team for 6 months so this is kind of a shit show

This other team that I could go to is a high-performing team with a lot of smart people. I really like the product and everything they're doing is extremely relevant in my opinion.

How I found a job in May 2020 as a recent graduate.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nrr3hk/how_i_found_a_job_in_may_2020_as_a_recent_graduate/,[],0.4,1622791772.0,"I am not a senior dev.

I am not mature enough as a dev to give some feedbacks or advice on your career choice.

&#x200B;

However, I think I am in a good position to tell you how I found a job as a recent grad.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I was in university,

I did **3 internships**:

\- 2 at the same company as a backend dev (Spring boot)

\- 1 at the same company but different role (Desktop application).

I could not find a permanent position at the company that I have worked because they were looking for a senior dev. So, I had to look for a job.

On my CV, I exaggerated what I did. Let's say the scrum master was absent **one day** and somehow, I played the role of the scrum master during the daily scrum meeting.

I wrote something shit like this

\- Organized the daily scrum meeting from time to time and helped to improve the team's performance.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I did **a few side-projects:**

\- 2 very simple video games (1 with Unity and 1 with Unreal)

\- 1 Desktop application (Using JavaFX; I know JavaFX sucks)

\- 1 blog-style website (MERN stack)

\- 1 React-Native application.

Some may disagree with me, but I think it is a good idea to try different fields as a student or as a recent graduate.

That's why I have done different side projects. I recorded how the application worked and posted on Youtube. Why?

\- To show recruiters during the career fair

\- To show that I actually have a product (People will not download an application from your github page)

On my CV, I wrote

\- the title of each side project

\- stacks

\- what I did (Maximum 3 bullet points).

For example

**Personal blog  (myblog.com)**

*stacks:* React, MongoDB, Node.js, Express                                           (Repo\*\*:\*\* linktorepo)

* Designed UI using **Wireframe** and **Figma**
* Designed and implemented APIs blablalbla

**Superduper desktop application  (Demo:**  [**https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ**](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)**)**

*stacks:* JavaFX, PostgreSQL                                                                   (Repo\*\*:\*\* linktorepo)

* Designed the DB architecture to optimize the performance
* Made the application more compatible on Mac.

You should not put unrelated side-projects.

If I am applying for a backend dev position, I wouldn't put video game side projects on my CV.

A good practice will be create different types of CV:

\- Backend

\- Frontend

\- Fullstack

Online assessment / Leetcode

What do you do as a Software Engineering Manager?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nrgpal/what_do_you_do_as_a_software_engineering_manager/,[],0.75,1622764285.0,"I've come across a few posts for software engineering managers, none of which ask for MBAs, but instead for ""highly technical people, with demonstrated skills in AI/ML"".

Most of these posts ask for lots of technical experience with various programming languages (example: 7+ years of project experience in C++).

Today a former recuiter I talked last week. Ask me to show up in friday and do a home assignment afterwards. I declined and I want to do more often or always from now on.

I provide a lot of things they can look into and clearly understand If I am the type of dude can do the job.

I feel like they dont want to hire anybody to begin with. They want to just sell and collect data, arrange backups of people if things go south and want to feel powerful in a psychopathic way.

I thought I'd be happy once I had my CS degree and was working as a developer. I got into one of those college-to-career tracks and things were looking up, but once I started I got blind-sighted with an IT job instead. I absolutely hate it -- I feel like I'm not doing the work that I wanted because I just fucking suck.

I'm completely disengaged from work, and I'm likely to lose my job soon... and I care, but seemingly not enough to do anything about it. I want a new job but I can barely bring myself to fill out job applications or complete coding assessments.

I can't get help because every fucking therapist and psychologist is unavailable. I've reached out to my friends but they're far and there's only so much they can do. My family is of no help either.

I'm 25 years old, currently learning Python since it's the easiest for beginners. I have some background in C++ from high school but it was a long time ago so it's kinda tricky for me in some parts.

**I'm just gonna write some of my goals and I'd definetly appreciate if you can tell me that I'm in the right path or not.**

**Realistic goals:**

* Help the community towards a more complex AI, examples:
* Create an AI-based software that is able to replicate sounds from automobile motors.
* Improve the current AI-based software that replicates Human voices (e.g. [https://www.resemble.ai/](https://www.resemble.ai/)) and make it completely customizable like a synthesizer on a DAW.

I'd also love to be a scientific researcher, working on the astroparticle physics branch of science. It's natural on me, I want to collaborate to the world with my grain of sand and I think programming is my best way to do it right now. Problem is, I need to be an astrophysicist first (if I'm not wrong) and that is a more realistic goal towards my 30's (or even 40's, time is not an issue).

**My plan:**

1. Python (+ NumPy, TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc)
2. R
3. C++ or Julia

**If you guys have any recommendations, I'd be glad to hear them too.**

**I would love to hear some clarification on this topic because I didn't find enough information online.**

**I love this subreddit a lot and it has given me tons of inspiration to keep going with my life.**

I've applied to dozens of places, and Revature is the only one that has gotten back to me regarding an offer. The training they offer sounds like it could be really good for me.

I wasn’t supposed to be a swe. After 3yrs I feel stuck.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nri4ma/i_wasnt_supposed_to_be_a_swe_after_3yrs_i_feel/,[],0.5,1622768004.0,"Hi all. I’m looking for some career advice. I did my bachelor in math and master in analytics. I applied to my current company for a data analyst role but somehow I was assigned to work on Scala/Spark at first and last 2 years I’m mostly doing Java backend. This is not what I was expecting at all but I took the opportunity to challenge myself and managed to survive until now. I was assigned to work on a bigger project this year and now I feel like I’ve really reached my limit and started questioning my career path. I tried to list out things that I love and hate about my experience so far and possible conclusions. 

Background:
- 3 yoe(Fortune 100). Late 20s. US based.


Things I love:
- Using programming as a tool. I sometimes write Google Sheets script functions to help business teams and that was very rewarding to me.
- Writing SQL querie
- Making dashboards and data visualization and thinking about what would be the best way to deliver information to clients 
- Agile Scrum practice. I like how tasks and deadlines are clearly defined
- API development and thinking about the best input and output format for better UI


Things I hate: 
- Constantly stressed about something will break. I’m always terrified about breaking the system by deploying something wrong that I don’t understand. 
- Network, server, resource management, scaling, building end to end architecture just feel like something I can never understand. I always try to memorize stuff to just get by but since I don’t fully understand how they work I fail to implement those skills unless I’m specifically told to use them. 
- Feel guilty about not working/studying after 5pm and on weekends . Everyone is working after 5 and even if I’m not working I know I have to study to survive in this industry. I don’t think I can do this for long term. 


Conclusions:
- Maybe I’m just burned out/depressed.  There’s been a lot going on in my personal life and I haven’t taken actual vacation since I started working full-time. Nowadays I often think nothing seems to matter anymore and just want to give up cs career. But I also feel like I don’t deserve to be burned out because I don’t contribute as much as other people who are working longer hours. 

- Maybe what I’m feeling is normal and I just need to try harder to become a better swe. 

- Maybe I should learn front end and become a front end developer since I like visualization. But 
I’m not sure how much frontend dev also need to learn about server, network, devops, etc. 

- Maybe I should pursue a different career path that uses programming only as a tool. So far I’ve looked into data analytics and digital marketing (SEO analytics). They look fun but I don’t think I fully understand what the job entails. Plus I’ve been away from analytics for 3 years so maybe it’s too late to go back. 




Do you think I love these things only because they are easy and I just need to try harder? Or is there another career path that suits my interest better?

Sometimes it’s from people in different time zones which is completely understandable, but with the majority of them being with people in the same time zone as me I’m wondering if this is standard/ work bringing up to management?

I have a few years of experience but the product I work on is new to me. I was assigned a mentor and I started working with her 3 weeks ago. She is the most tenured engineer in our team including the manager.

However she is extremely rude to me in private meetings. She spent most of the time yelling/insulting me. I am a guy and I almost cried during one of the meetings. I am learning almost nothing useful from her. 

After the first week I apologized to her and hoped that she will change. She remained the same in the second week. I haven't talked to her since and I feel afraid/depressed to talk to her. Last week I told my manager what happened.

My manager is a nice guy. He talked to her and gave me instructions on how to improve my skills. He said that if I do these things then I don't need her.

But I need a mentor. This product is new to me and I know that if I made mistake/ didn't perform then it will be on me.

I want to stay in this company as it is one of the largest tech companies and there is a lot to learn from them. What should I do?"

I'm a 22 yr old, recent cs graduate with no work experience or technical internships. I've been actively seeking jobs/internships related to my field for the past 9 months since I've graduated. The country I'm currently situated in has a bad job market for my field.

I've spent quite a lot of time and money on my degree, and I'm qualified for junior roles with reasonable requirements as I've seen around the world, but now I'm not getting anywhere with it. 

I've tried looking up ways to go abroad, but I haven't found a way pertaining to cs.

For a masters, the advice I've gotten is to work first and see what you like and only then do masters with some specialization. Since I can't find jobs in the first place, that won't work.

The other option I've thought of is to share accommodation abroad somehow while I apply there, but I'm by myself and have no relatives or friends abroad, so that can't work. Also most companies prefer hiring candidates from their country anyways so my chances are less.

For going abroad, my country of preference has been Canada. I'm open to other countries as well that are good for my field, but the above problem sustains.

I'm pretty much stuck right now and time's running out for me. Soon it'll be a year since graduation and I'm quite worried. All I want is a job to break into the industry and make some money, but I've been getting nowhere.

I'm seeking some advice about what I can do in this situation to get a job or go abroad or any other options I might have no considered yet.

My general understanding with reply is that they are pretty much a bodyshop in the same league as FDM, renature, WITCH (Wipro Infosys TCS Cognizant HCL).

As in you're not a genuine consultant, but a warm body who is loaned/rented out to a client company as a consultant to do low-level tasks/projects such as data entry/support, and you are severely underpaid for it. I also assume you face steep fees if you leave early. Point of contention for me is they appear to brand themselves particularly well.

It's got pretty poor reviews on Glassdoor which were integral in me reaching my conclusion of it being a body shop which sells recent graduates the dream of being a consultant, whilst giving them awful pay and placing them on the tasks no-one wants to do.

Anyone have anything to contribute on experiences with reply, or the general reputation of this company?

Then the HR sent me a take-home assignment for which they informed they would send me and that I have one week to complete and explain later through a presentation via share screen how I did it since it's also a project that I will keep solely for myself and the company gets nothing from it regardless of the final result. Here is the assignment and I hope I'm being clear here since I have to hide certain parts:

""Make a call to the url \[insert cloud storage link\] which will return in JSON format, data from 10 products from \[insert company name\].  

Create a /home page which, if authentication has not been done, will send you to /login where data for connection will be required. If the user gives the correct information (a test user has been created) then the / home page will be displayed where a ""welcome"" message will be displayed and there will be a menu with the options:  

Home 

Product list 

Log out  

The ""Home"" menu will send you to the / home page.   

The ""Product List"" menu will send you to a page where there will be a button that will call the \[insert company name\] call and update the product database (first initialization and then update). 

After initialization it will display on the same page in a list (preferably jquery datatable) the products that the call will return to \[insert company name\]. 

On this page there will be an option to add a product (where a new page will open with a form), an option to edit as well as an option to delete and create the corresponding validation for those.  

The ""Logout"" menu will logout the user and send you to the page /login.    

Use .NET 5, NodeJS / NPM(this was never mentioned in the job requirements or during the interview) and SQL Server for this project.""

So after reading this during my shift(this might played a part too, I guess?), I felt overwhelmed and unsure if I should work on this and am thinking of sending them an email of thanking them for the consideration but I'm not willing to invest my time on this since it feels it will take me more than 2 hours to finish while also working 40+ hours per week as well. 

TL;DR: Applied to new job while being employed, interview went well but I don't feel like doing the lengthy(at least to me) take-home assignment they sent. 

What's your overall experience with this kind of assignments especially when you were already employed?

Thanks in advance!"
How Important is It to Have the Years of Experience a Job Posting Claims to Require?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nrimms/how_important_is_it_to_have_the_years_of/,[],0.25,1622769285.0,"I'm a dev with fewer than 6 months of experience, and I'm applying to new jobs right now. There are plenty of jobs that require 1+ or 2+ years of experience in such a role. How likely are employers with such positions to accept a dev with much less than a year of experience? And, I think more importantly, how likely are such jobs going to be willing to essentially train a guy from the ground up? (i.e., if I apply to such a job and get it, will the employer likely be under the assumption that I'm maybe better-prepared than I actually am, and conceivably overestimate my abilities?) 

I'm sure I know what many of you will say: apply anyway. The worst that can happen is that they say no. And I can mention my expectations for training in the interview. The reason I ask is that I want to reserve my energy applying for jobs I'm reasonably likely to qualify for. There are countless jobs out there, and I just don't want to waste my time in submitting applications for jobs I have only the slightest chance of getting."

I also know that I'm interested in FinTech, especially leveraging Data Science in the financial field, but beyond that, I'm not sure. I have not even considered careers outside of the CS domain, but Management Consulting also interests me, and I hope to get an MBA sometime in the future.

I feel stuck as a C++ developer. I have three years of experience and I'm currently living in Romania. I feel pretty knowledgeable in OOP, template programming, concurrency, STL, Qt, gtest&gmock, software design, core dump analysis, various tools, Linux etc... I also have a master's degree and I'm am a TA at my university (i'm teaching Operating Systems to some poor souls).

A good friend of mine is a very talented back end developer, also with 3 years of experience, but knows things like Go, AWS, Docker, Google Cloud, Snowflake and now he's learning Ruby and React at the job.

We both wanted to work abroad or remotely for a company abroad, because in Romania we are treated as cheap labor and we want the big bucks. As soon as my friend started searching, he effortlessly found a good position as a remote contractor for a company in UK, for 3.5x the salary he had before, while living in Romania.

For me the story is more complicated. For some reason, no one wants to hire remote C++ devs, so all jobs require relocation. I found one remote position in UK, but it still required a work permit for occasional business related travel (which is pretty hard to obtain now, due to Brexit). There are very few opportunities for me out there, but I find there are a lot more for senior devs (5/7+ years of experience).

I feel a bit stuck in the moment and I'm faced with an important decision that may impact my life from now on:

1. Stay with C++ and later gain access to those senior roles. I feel like this is the safe one, given the fact that what I know is a lot less prone to changes and things relatively stay the same (with some exceptions). Also, I get to build up further on what I already know. But, opportunities are scarce and freelance gigs and almost non existent.
2. Start gaining some fancier, more in demand skills. I'll have to start from scratch with a junior dev salary. I feel pretty shitty about throwing these 3 years of hard work in the trash bin. Also, things are more prone to changes and I think there is more work to keep my knowledge up to date. But, opportunities and money could be more plentiful.

I need some advice here."

I loved my classes in school and really enjoyed the problem solving aspects, like my discrete math and data science classes, and solving my programming projects in general. But I feel like I don’t get to do that much coding at work; so much more of my time is spent on access requests, back and forth with QA, Agile ceremonies, release planning tasks, random infrastructure stuff that my team has to take on—I hate all that stuff. I spend maybe 10% of my time actually doing what I like. I also seriously hate production support. Like, would gladly take a pay cut to avoid doing it. I also don’t do well with full-time remote work, which we’ve transitioned to permanently, and we’ve been losing a lot of devs due to the fact that we’re undergoing a merger, so I’m having to take on projects that are way beyond my skill level and with that much stress, my mental health is in the toilet.

I’m too Insecure to ask for a raise (it’s complicated),4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nr4b08/im_too_insecure_to_ask_for_a_raise_its_complicated/,[],0.7,1622721438.0,"I was hired 3.5 years ago at a small communications company here in the US. I was hired to do video tech work on some specialized equipment in house. This was my dream job, my 1st real job in a company with benefits and structure.

However, reality set in and I found that I hated the competitive toxic culture in my department. Some of the folks there had been around 6+ years at least. Also the long hours destroyed my mental health. I would get in at 8am and leave at 10pm 6 days a week. 

I didn’t have time for a life never mind a girlfriend. After 8 months of that, I realized I couldn’t change it, nor I could bring myself to conform to it, even though I still liked the work and other folks here. 

It was then that I started to learn cs on my own through udemy, books and practice. It turned out that around that time, a small dev team was forming in my company. I took note of that and asked the people involved with it if I could work on part of a project.

Fast forward to feb 2020 before the pandemic affected the company, my role in the dev team
had greatly increased. I created and maintained software (front end, back end, db, dev ops) in top and low level languages on 10+ services. I’d gained so much experience from getting in on them early on and really ran with it. I know it sounds crazy, but I learned a ton in the year prior. I also genuinely like the other folks on the dev team. They are super generous with their knowledge and are really chill with work life balance.

When the pandemic affected the company, they allowed me to move to a different city (5hrs away) in the same state, thus making me full time remote-ish during the pandemic. 

They still have me perform some of the non physical aspects of the tech job. But because of Covid, the tech job has become 90% remote and 10% at the office. I do the tech job pretty well as I am the only one in that dept of 6 people that documents workflows, learns new tools and feed it to the other folks. 

One frustrating part in my view is that they haven’t brought me on entirely as a software dev.  But this is secondary. The worst is that my salary does not reflect the 2 jobs I’m performing as I’m technically and in title still a tech person with extra duties.

I am not experienced to earn a senior dev salary, but I know I can earn a mid level dev salary easily (88k-100k according to google). Now I’m making on the low end of that doing both functions.

How would an insecure person like myself approach my boss (whom is actually a pretty reasonable person) on getting a raise? 

I understand and am grateful they have been flexible. Why do I feel like an ass for asking them for a raise even though I know I deserve it? The lead dev even has stated to my boss several times that I am fully capable of going dev as a dedicated role. They also haven’t given me a raise for over 1 year. 

I don’t want to lose good faith over asking. Specially now that I bought a nice condo and am taking care of a sick relative. I do really need the money and health benefits. 

Should I just take the fact they are being flexible as a raise and shut up for another year?"

I'm a Scrum Master that is stuck in a career rut. My current role offers very limited prospects for advancement and I feel as though I cannot accomplish anything for my team.

What I can do with these skills?

I've long since given up that bullshit fantasy of having a dream job (whatever that's supposed to be for me) and just want a secure career with good opportunities for advancement. Or just one of the two, frankly.

I was initially hired out of college 2 years ago with good pay and good benefits as a Business Analyst. But I've basically been involved in job role pinball ever since, and I've spent the past 18 months or so as a Scrum Master for a shared service team. I feel as though I can't meaningfully contribute and I feel like my skills are deteriorating. Moreover, I just barely survived a round of layoffs from the grace of my manager and I've been stuck in this limbo state where I'm responsible for trying to make this team agile. 

At the moment I feel like I'm trapped and delaying the inevitable and I want to have an out. I don't really have a given passion for anything, so I'm open to suggestions. I just want to feel good about the work that I do and have a chance to grow from it."

Still have a good relationship with my boss and we still stay in touch every so often.

After a month(OCTOBER) I found a new job. I was signed up as an Angular dev even though I was honest with them that I have always been a React developer, they said during the hiring process that they also have space for React developers. They also said that they have this “OPENNESS” in which it is easy to talk to managers for requests and stuff. When I started they put us in this new team without any structure. We had one senior FE dev who started the same time as us but he resigned after 2 months and warned us that the new company has shown red flags. I ignored it since I needed the job and we have several avenues for learning. We were always on training and never given any real-world coding tasks. Took advantage of the Pluralsight tutorials for Angular and getAbstract but felt that it might not be enough for development once we start.

By January, the team was dissolved, they just cut the project short. I asked my lead if he can put me in a project for React since they sent an email blast that they were hiring developers for React. He told me that Angular was the direction of the company as a whole. So I said okay, even though the React community is more active than Angular in our channels. I was put in mobile development even though I signed up for web development.

My first task was to do cleanup of the existing code and to provide missing code coverage. I was not given proper Knowledge Transfer about what the app does or what the specific modules do. They just let me do unit tests for them. We accomplished the task (mostly me, I was a mid dev) but it was stressful since none of the feature owners took some time to help even though we requested for it.

After 2 weeks they had issues with the tests again because they fixed some bugs causing the unit tests to break. This baffles me, and they assigned the tests to me again, without letting me know the changes they made. The codebase is usually 1500 lines long per component. It is hard to read and to debug. We also have 8 modules/repositories in this project that are interrelated. Most tests when I was doing them doesn’t have any assertions on them. I relayed this to the team but they made me feel like I was a villain. Mind you, these are senior devs. 

The new iteration is now starting and our Manager told us beforehand to step up and take tasks. So I did, I felt like I could learn more in it. The epic is separated into different tasks and they gave me the last part of the task which is the integration. I quickly finished with the page but was waiting until Monday for the other components(the deadline is Monday too). I told the Scrum Master that I still have dependencies on other devs and basically was just given a day to develop. They had error testing that same day as well. Everything was going wrong so I told him that I have programmed it but I cannot test it since we were on mobile and we needed to sign in through Azure. They had the endpoints down that day. I told him(SM) that I won’t be able to submit a PR, but he convinced me to at least have an initial check. So I did submit a PR. The senior devs did a code review and merged it immediately. I had many bugs filed but I closed them all and we were able to present.

That was so stressful to me and had my skin broke out in rashes, I had to take a day off work after the sprint and check with my dermatologist. She told me that it was due to stress. The rashes has happened before but that was when something bad happened to my love one.

They told me I did a good job and thought “okay”. The Delivery Manager even gave me a commendation. A few weeks after he is asking for a report to explain why the bugs were filed. I was confused because I messaged him and reported to him what has been happening, that we need more time for integration work. This has also been relayed to the SM. It felt like I was being burned at the stake, when we were asked to report why there are many bugs.

I went to my dentist after this because my braces got loose and she asked if I was stressed. I said yes, I seem to be clenching my jaw during sleep which has never happened to me before.

Now, I am so afraid of making mistakes and am having panic attacks. I can’t seem to love what I am doing anymore. I feel really depressed that even though I am not that good as a developer at least I love what I am doing and is hard-working. But it seems that it has taken the joy out of me.

I feel incompetent and feel like it is just not a good fit for me, I talked to my lead about this and he calmed me down. He told me that I should not be blamed solely for this and that this is a team effort.

I can’t go to work because I am overwhelmed with how everything is. I am thinking of taking a break to talk to a psychiatrist and get treatment. I also have personal stuff that I have going on. But I need money since I am the breadwinner in my family. I don’t know if I should find a job right away or just take a break until I get better. It has gotten to a point where I just don’t want to exist anymore.

TLDR: Should I take a break or find a new job or stay at current job? New job is taking a toll on mental health.

I recently had my on site with Intuit a few days ago and I'm pretty confident it went well. I expect them to come back with an offer. But I currently am in a pretty decent position at my current company and thanks to covid my RSUs have essentially ballooned.

**About me:**\- I am currently in the bay area.

\- Current salary and RSUs (130K Base + $160K RSUs to be vested by the end of 2023)

\- after discussing the salary range with hiring manager pre interviews at intuit i was told I'll probably receive something around $140K Base with 100K RSUs (over 4 years). This would be lower than what I'm currently making.

\- **Key Factor:**\- I HATE my job. I'm completely burnt out and on the verge of just walking out. Its not just me, everyone around me is in a similar situation due to mismanagement at the org level and looks like things are just getting worse. Everyone is just tolerating right now as the stock price keeps rising as their tolerance does as well.

\- I've put in internal transfers to other orgs within the company to see if i can stay and keep my current package but that seems like it might take a while to process as its still early stages and I'm worried that tomorrow Intuit is going to come with their initial offer.

**What I want to know is:**how can I negotiate with Intuit so that they match or beat what I'm currently getting? If they Match what i'm currently getting id jump in a heartbeat. Is this an unreasonable amount/ask? Should i just be honest with them about my current RSUs and salary and ask they match it? Whats the best way to manage this?

**PS:**When i told them the range was a bit low, they said they can do ""something"" with sign on bonuses."

New Startup Job with some odd issues,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nr1cu6/new_startup_job_with_some_odd_issues/,[],1.0,1622711505.0,"## Backstory
I'm a Fullstack Software dev that's been working in the field for about 5 years and I have some concern over my new job. For context, I've worked for multiple other companies ranging from large consulting firms to small startups, primarily as a full-stack dev but also as a dedicated frontend resource. Before my current position, I was a Senior Software Engineer working with an architecture team on developing a new app for a decent-sized company, I left that previous position because of management pushing for faster crappier code just so they could get something out the door faster to sell.

## Problem
This new position (which I've been at for about 2 months) is a Software Developer position working for a startup whose values I align with and are working on a cool product. I was offered this position even though I'm not familiar with the specific technologies, but with similar ones (i.e. I know React, they use Vue). The problem I'm having though is my time on the development team has been unpleasant. The manager has never managed before (under a year experience total as manager), I'm the first new hire he has brought onto the team and I feel the expectations are a bit off. Here are some of the oddities I've run into:

-  Was questioned about why I'm ramping up so slowly 2 weeks into the job while the first 4 days were all HR meetings.
- Extensive Pair programming demands, 4-6 hours a day, brief 15 minutes breaks occasionally. (This stopped after the end of week 3 after both I and the other developer were burnt out of being on video that much)
- I was outright told that they had thought I was more competent in these technologies even though I told them outright I did not know them but was willing to learn them.. (They also acknowledged this)
- When receiving my 30-day review I was told I was expected to know the whole app top to bottom by 90 days, and that my current score in many categories was 10%. i.e. App comprehension, data-flow, Code Feedback. 
- During this review I was lambasted for cherry-picking easy bug tickets. We are in a feature freeze, and my tickets were assigned by my pair programming partner.
- We are also migrating the tech stack significantly and I'm expected to learn new and old tech (as I would expect) but quick enough that I will be responsible for migrating a large portion of the complicated codebase to the new platform. (This by itself would be a minor gripe but combined with everything else seems off)

My manager doesn't speak English as his first language and perhaps much of the above is a misunderstanding but it seems to be reinforced this way when I've reached out for clarity. Other co-workers have said he's just rough around the edges, but that first one on one meeting felt more aggressive than some of the reprimands that I've gotten in the past. One of the reasons I switched jobs was because I was feeling burnt out and wanted a fresh start, this was not what I expected and I'm wondering what others' thoughts on it are?

## TLDR
 New job and new manager feel off and I'm looking for some feedback."

Hi all,

Hope you all are doing great. I was wondering whether some one could provide some tips to handle the situation which I'm about to be in.

I have been unemployed for too long and I'm almost close to having an offer in hand. I'm a Python developer(average). I underwent this interview for a Python developer in company X. The first stage was a take-home assignment and I cleared it with flying colors(according to them). Then I had a discussion with the MD which went well. Then I was invited to their office to have a discussion with the team.  As they put it, it would just be a discussion on tech stack and stuff they use. I went to their office hoping to meet with the team, but things weren't so simple as they said. 

As it turns out company X is a sister concern of company A. They required only two developers and I turned out to be a third one, which I'm not sure is a mistake or they were impressed by my work. But now they want me to be part of company Y, which is also a part of company A. Company Y currently has no team, it's just a senior developer and the CTO. The senior developer is working on a project by himself and has completed 80% of the MVP. Now what they want is me to join company Y to and to take the ownership of the code base. During the first meeting the CTO guy didn't show up and the tech lead guy asked me to come back after a week. Then we three are supposed to sit together and they will walk me through the codebase and if all is well and good they will give me the offer.

Now this is the part which I'm worried about. 

What should I really be expecting?

Is this a sort of evaluation or something?

How to handle such a situation?

It's getting pretty ridiculous, like I haven't been able to get any work done for the past 2 weeks because I'm waiting for him to fix some credentials issue related to an account he provided to me so I can deploy a pipeline.

I recently got turned down for a fairly entry-level job(don't wanna put them on blast they seem like a cool place to work) and I'm not quite sure what I'm doing wrong, where to improve, etc., and it'd be nice to get an answer before applying to a million more jobs and getting rejected a million more times. 

Is it a weird thing to email someone who turned me down? It's something I haven't really considered to date but I feel like it'd at least give me some closure and something to work towards. If it's not incredibly weird, what would be the best way to phrase it without seeming pushy, or worse? 

If it is incredibly weird,  what else can I do? what are some steps I can take to find out the problem and fix it? 

For a bit of background, I have about 4-5 years of full-stack development experience, I did a bootcamp circa late 2019/pre-pandemic 2020 and before that took some classes at community college but am largely self-taught.

How important is a summer internship/job vs side projects/aspirational startups?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nqxt60/how_important_is_a_summer_internshipjob_vs_side/,[],0.67,1622700624.0,"To give some background, I just finished sophomore year of undergrad.

Pay isn't important to me as purpose, and if I'm not interested in what the startup/company is doing, I'd much rather work on my own side projects, contribute to OSS, study CS stuff, or attempt to start my own business.

In fact, that's what I'm working on now, although I hesitate to call them startups, since I'm really the only one working on them, there's not really any structure/deadline. My question is, how would future companies view a ""great"" side project vs. an internship at some random SWE company?

It involves working with both business and technical skills and building up/adding new features to their trading platform. 

I'm not sure which to pursue. I have a computer science masters where I took a decent number of ML classes and I think it would be cool to put it to use so to speak and of course I am interested in data science and machine learning. Plus I'm concerned that if I don't take this opportunity now I might have a hard time if I ever want to go into data science or machine learning engineering later without relevant data science or machine learning experience. For the software engineering job, most of my previous experience is in or around software engineering and I know I enjoy the type of work. Plus I really like finance, investing, trading, etc so I think it would be really cool to work so close to the trading desks.  I know with my background it wouldn't be hard to ever switch back to software engineering if I did end up going into data science, it's just that I'm not sure how likely it would be that I could get into a job so close to the trading desks and I could potentially use this as an eventual stepping stone to quant development.

About a year ago I was interviewing for a position at a VR company. I was their top pick of 3 applicants, and since this is what I studied in college I was ecstatic to get it. They ended up going with an inside hire at the last minute.

Afterwards I spent a few months job searching and settled for a QA position at a fortune 500 company. I don’t care for the job, or the company, and find myself unmotivated and uninspired about my work. However the job security is great (as I’m not the best at it but they still keep me around) and it pays well enough for me to afford my lifestyle.

Now the VR company is recruiting again, and a recruiter has reached out to me asking if I’m interested. I am, but am worried that I’ve only been at my current job 4 months. Is that too soon to leave? I’d lose a few hundred bucks in my 401k too.

If the VR company were to hire me, I’m not sure if leaving a job this quick is frowned upon and could hurt my job prospects in the future."

These meetings consist of design reviews, discussions on future projects and team roadmap, knowledge sessions, approval meetings (I work in a sensitive domain with red-tape and everything is scrutinized thoroughly), daily standup, team sync etc. This is after I reject ad-hoc meetings scheduled by PMs to discuss issues. I barely get time to do real work. Even a single meeting scheduled at 1:00 PM makes me unable to focus on my work before and too tired to work after (I resonate with \[Maker vs. Manager schedule\]([http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html))). I observed a few of my seniors and they also go through the same (even more meetings than me). My manager says that this is how SDEs function at big tech. Basically, overall SDEs take part in synchronous communication to drive projects/things a lot more than coding. I get that as you grow in your role, senior engineers do all these things. The problem is - for mid-senior engineers like me, it becomes a burden as I have to do all these things, along with my tasks from ongoing projects - which requires real work to be done. Thus, I feel that managers are aptly working on manager’s schedule while even though I am a maker, I don’t get to work on maker’s schedule. My previous job was at a startup in India where we barely had meetings - most of our communication was informal chat - and didn’t feel like burden at all. It didn’t have structure at all but I never felt overwhelmed and disconnected from my work.

How does a normal day look for you all at your workplace? At the risk of generalizing things, can I assume that there will be less meetings and interruptions at startups?

Question about misleading requirements user stories handling,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nqvxx9/question_about_misleading_requirements_user/,[],1.0,1622695668.0,"Hey fellow IT guys out there. I do have a question on dealing with very highly missleading story writers who just copy-paste other people writings without actually understanding what is required.

I do know that i do have flaws in understanding stories from all sides of analytical stuff, but mostly i do literally take the fact that any story should be available to be picked up by any dev in the team, i am trying to make all communication publicly under the story, but seems we as a team have no way to control this, story writers add stories in 1-2 days before iteration starts and not from backlog, but completely new ones. As well i look for facts inside the stories to get a complete picture from description to acceptance criteria, going through code.

Story 1 itself looks like this:

Description:
Do a database modification x and add a new duplicate record strawberry, launch the tests z, y, p and check if all goes well.


Acceptance criteria:
1. Add a banana into test z and use the new strawberry to see if flows works, do verifications
2. Add a kiwi into the test y and use the new strawberry to see if flow works, do verifications
3. The new strawberry has to be returned aswell with test p, do verifications

Story 1 description ends.

Another story: all questions are do the same as previous, which appears to be one of core things missed as it is not the same as previous, another story which is dependent on functionality fully not working as intended.

 About story 1:
So basically one of the devs who went on vacation knew all the background, the guy who wrote the story - did not, so the AC 3 did not made any sense in how the code works at all. Basically to achieve all 3 acceptance criterias in the story was about rewriting almost full functionality from scratch as database modification x is a core key for functionality.

So after scratching my head and trying to understand what is required as well as talking with fellow teammates they seemed to be clueless as well.

I took a step forward and asked directly our story writer about the actual business case which they want to handle, he had no information, so i went to more senior one - it appears, that strawberry has to be blue, with one leaf left on top of it. Even with those modifications it seems that acceptance criteria 3 would be a complete nonsence to test which i did not get a confirmation for even from more senior story writer. So i handled this in the way which appeared the best for me:

- I did the initial analysis based on all information given as per user story to match all acceptance criterias.
- As per User story definition clearly asked if the acceptance criteria 3 has any relavance and what the actual values of strawberry has to be
- Based on my analysis gave other 7 questions that would get impacted by this type of modification which covers all 3 acceptance criterias and if that is expected
- Added 2 more alternative solution possibilities to achieve whats required by the story itself on all 3 acceptance criterias with much less effort
- Pinged the story writers in the chat with the added comments and to respond to them.


No answer for multiple days, iteration ended.

So i just want to understand what more senior developers would do in this situation? 

As per me myself i just simply got tired of that type of stories being one after another with keywords - the same as functionality c, explain how does it work right now after each question of requirements which dont meet real world or absolutely or are just different from how currently the system works or even a story which even with the best efforts of multiple people cannot be done till deadline(not only mine opinion). In general i am really not a very pushy person.

Also, what should I say when I contact them. I'm not worried about my background check or drug test results as all are clean, but I don't want to see crazy, or worried.

Thanks for your help!"

Any jobs where I can just schedule my 9-5 and not have to worry about it from 5:01pm-8:59am?  


Almost a decade into my professional web development career and I'm pretty burnt out.

They don't drive and my mom is retired on disability and live 1.5 hours away. So I'm there every week if not more to drive them to get groceries (mom doesn't trust the internet to order it online), bring them to appointments, etc. On top of that my girlfriend lives 4 hours away and trying to make that work has been it's own stress.  


The reason I'm giving you my life story is to say, a lot more people than I suffer when I'm on call, or am expected to take time out of my personal life in order to achieve some goals set at the beginning of the year. In all fairness, I set most of them myself and gave myself the responsibility, but they asked for personal growth which I don't get time off of work to do.  


With that said, I was wondering if there are any CS related careers out there that are just 9-5 and that's it.

Revature contract buyout question (specific),1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nqnrls/revature_contract_buyout_question_specific/,[],0.67,1622674860.0,"I know this sub gets a lot of Revature questions but after a long google search I can't find the answer to this one question:

It's well known that you sign a 2 year contract with Revature that starts when you get picked up by your first client.  Also, apparently in some cases, the client can buy your contract.  What does that mean?  Is the company buying the remaining time on your contract - ie. if you still owe Revature 1 year, they are buying *you* for 1 year?  Or, does it mean that they are paying any penalties (at a discount, I'm sure) that you would be liable for if you stopped working at Revature?

I get that you sign to work for Revature for 2 years, absolutely 100% crystal on that. What I don't quite understand is that if you are 'sold' what part of you IS actually sold?

Is it required to do coding problems for any job that involves programming?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nqsw0d/is_it_required_to_do_coding_problems_for_any_job/,[],0.25,1622687902.0,I was wondering if it is required to having to do those coding problems for other jobs that would require programming like mechatronics engineer or robotics engineer etc.
Getting back into programming from cloud administration?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nqh8v3/getting_back_into_programming_from_cloud/,[],1.0,1622652539.0,"Hey guys, to keep this short, I'm currently a cloud admin in a very big financial institution and as you can guess you're expected to be available 24/7. The job itself isn't hard for me, but I'm starting to hate the environment and hate not knowing when I'll finish my work today.

So I'm planning to go back to programming after I finish my contract in 3 months, and I have a few questions:

-I don't have any professional experience in programming and I have graduated ~2 years ago (immediately went into this cloud admin job). Will I be able to score a programming job?

-How can I use the next three months to sharpen and retrieve my programming skills?

-should I be ok with the unavoidable pay downgrade if I start over as a programmer? Or should I suck it up and stay at this job?

Sidenote: I know how to program in c++, Java, php and python, I have very small html background and a small APIs knowledge"
Putting in my 2 weeks notice tomorrow,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nqc7kl/putting_in_my_2_weeks_notice_tomorrow/,[],0.83,1622633124.0,"Hello, not much of a question but I’m nervous as hell. Any advice on how to do this is greatly appreciated. Only have done it a few times, but never for a full-time job. Been working with this company for about a year, it’s my first full-time position out of university. I got a little too excited and took my first job offer despite not having a good feeling (I was also blinded by the money). This is a busy, busy time of year and my boss will definitely be blindsided. I know business is business, I need to do what’s best for me, and they’d drop me in a second if they’d had to. But any words of encouragement are appreciated. There are no hard feelings, just was not a good fit ..at all."
Where do I even start? I feel so utterly paralyzed. I feel like I have the skills and that I don't know how to do anything at the same time..,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nqh1pj/where_do_i_even_start_i_feel_so_utterly_paralyzed/,[],0.75,1622651672.0,"I know web design. I know how to work with databases. I know several programming languages (Java, PHP, JS). I know frameworks. I know Android. I have a CS bachelor's..

..and, yet, I feel like I absolutely cannot do anything. Job postings terrify me. I'm on Upwork trying to see anything I can do and it all sounds so foreign.

My biggest problem is that I have absolutely no clue what my job should be. I have no clue what would be needed from me. I look at all this weird slang and acronyms and while I do try to Google it it is so overwhelming. I feel like I have to graduate a course every time I look something up.

I feel like I should just say ""fuck it"" and go work in fast food for the rest of my life. That's just how I feel sometimes. A part of me wishes I quit this early but, I don't know.. the sunk cost fallacy is real and programming seems to be the only reliable job.

Anyway, please help with the following: 

* Where can I learn the slang? The acronyms make me feel so out of touch and like a really bad programmer.

* Can you please explain what you do on a weekly basis? It would help so much, knowing what people actually do. I feel like I have the ingredients without knowing how the cake is made, so it all comes out horrible.

* I really want to get into software development. I feel like web design has sucked out my soul. I want to do software dev and to make Chrome extensions.. where should I start off?"
Is it safe to post school projects on GitHub?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nqmqm0/is_it_safe_to_post_school_projects_on_github/,[],0.6,1622672010.0,"I see mixed opinions about this. I do not post or include every school project on my resume. But some of my school projects are equivalent to personal projects. I had freedom to implement them however to achieve the functionality or the apps in mind. And I know that some recruiters or interviewers like to see the code of the projects on resume or in LinkedIn. I have read though how other students that copy from graduated students’ GitHub can cause the graduated student to lose his degree or if the student is a current student, he can get in trouble for posting the code online in the first place. I am confused on what to do in the situation.  Does anyone have tips?"

In my teen years I was more into design, and still am. I still have that dream of making my video games and made some flash games as a teen. Albeit I made the games majorly through design and the coding was half-assed. One example of my creation: ([https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/404674](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/404674))

Unfortunately, life was never good to me. At 17 years old my parents divorced and went their separate ways and left me behind in a foreclosed home. I graduated highschool through an online program, thankfully, so I have a HS Diploma. Not knowing what the hell I needed to do to survive the first thing I did was get a job, I live in Las Vegas, and found myself in the food and hospitality industry, waiting tables. I tried going to a community college but balancing work and school, with no family, and crippling depression was impossible for me... So I chose work, which would keep a roof over my head and food in my stomach. 10 years later, I'm waiting tables, which can be lucrative here since this is a tourist city. I was hell bent on getting a server position at a fancy restaurant, which I eventually did but lost and am now serving at a lower-end restaurant making about 30-35k annually. I hate it, and this isn't what I wanted to do with my life.

tl;dr:

Abandoned kid, had to give up school to work, but wants to make a change.

How would one in a position such as mine even begin a path in CS? Right now I'm taking coursera certifications for ux design and learning programming from codecademy and youtube videos. I hope to one day be on one side of the spectrum (whether it be in the design or programming side of CS) but I really need advice and guidance.

Should I go back to school? Community college or UNLV?  Would piling debt upon myself for a degree be the smart move?

Should I aim for a bunch of certifications? Is it even possible for someone with the resources I have to consider continuing this route?

What are my options? Or even better what would be the best way to break my way into a career in CS?"

"How do I handle an insecure, toxic, new coworker?",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lrf569/how_do_i_handle_an_insecure_toxic_new_coworker/,[],0.65,1614208379.0,"Hi guys not sure if this is the right place to post this. But here it goes. 

I started a new job a few weeks ago after graduating. And a week before I started my job, a new girl also started. Anyways, so I assume I have been talked about quite a bit in a positive light since when I started I've gotten really on top of getting familiar with company policies, and getting things done (since there were multiple IT errors and I went out of my way to resolve them). My manager has openly told me that he feels like he made a great choice in hiring me since I make sure to get things done, and I've even taught him new things that he isn't aware of at our company! (Since it's huge). It's awesome having a great manager since my last internship I had a not so great one. My nickname at work from my manager is gamer girl (since I make games on the side and play them a lot, even showed some of them to him as well).

Anyways me and the new girl formally met a week ago since our manager finally got the time to get us newbies meeting. So she went out of her way to msg me afterwards and I thought she was nice, and that it was nice to be friends with a fellow newbie. Anyways we both got assigned a really tiny project that our manager said is just for fun (and he told me himself that even if I did absolutely nothing he wouldn't think badly because as long as we get familiar with the software, it's fine). The new girl was really insecure about everything (especially with coding since she has no background in it), so I went out of my way to help her out since she had very minimal experience and I had previous experience at internships and etc. I felt bad, and didn't want to seem... Rather extra with the work I do. Especially since my friends who worked in other companies have said when you show you can do a lot of work, then you get a heavy workload and get burnt out quickly.

We had to present it on Friday, and next thing I know, I see she went all out, like using Photoshop and everything for the intro project. So I was shocked cuz she kept complaining and crying to me saying she didn't know anything but clearly she did and it really threw me off. After the presentation was over, she approached me and was like ""wow you didn't do so bad!"" I was disappointed because I did the minimum of what was expected, when I could've done much better. But she just went above and beyond of what was required, even doing things that didn't even exist in the requirements.

Since then I've kept my guard up, because I had a not so good feeling from her. So this week is when formal training started. All she has been doing is talking over me when I'm in the middle of talking. And when we got an assignment to do together, she ghosted me and teamed up with another new team member (who started on Monday). But any time she needs help she msgs me and starts buttering me up so I can help her. I give her simple replies because last thing I want is a toxic work environment. Fast forward to today, the new team member was confused over something so he shared his screen on Zoom. He accidentally opened his slack and I saw the barrage of messages between the two where she's talking badly about me. He quickly minimized it before I got to read the whole thing, but I'm really unhappy about it. Immediately after, she messages me hi through our company messaging app. I say hi and leave it at that.

But now that I know she's definitely a toxic coworker who's also new like me, what can I do to call her out on this or resolve this? I just want to make sure that what she's doing won't harm my reputation with my manager and won't make me look bad. I worked really hard to get this job, and I don't want to lose it or give it up for someone who is just being mean for no reason when I've only done nothing but help her out."
