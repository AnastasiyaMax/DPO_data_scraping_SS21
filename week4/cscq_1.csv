She will be finishing her bachelors and wants to go on to her masters in Law (with the practice LSAT scores she has been getting, she is looking to get into a good law school but probably not a 'top' one from my understanding). And thus begins the search to find the best city for the both of us.

The basic requirements are:

* Good law school
* A decent amount of tech jobs available
* We both love getting out into nature so the closer we are to that the better
* Preferably liberal

I am moving from a smaller city in Europe so I would prefer not to live in somewhere with a big homeless problem or that is unsafe, as I feel like that would be a lot for me to adjust to and I don't think I would be happy somewhere like that.

When I jumped into this project I was surprised how little the junior knew. He had jumped in from an SQL role to test out front end development. He attended a short bootcamp earlier and thats all his experience in programming.


I spend a lot of time every day explaining his tickets to him. I told him he can call me any time and we can look at the problems together. I had the idea that I'll hold his hand for the first handful of tickets until he becomes self sufficient and gets more confident in our dev environment and our coding style.


Now, when I started out as a junior, I had self-studied and taken a couple really demanding uni courses on programming so I was pretty comfortable when I started my first job. Its been now 6 months that Ive helped this junior and I just got off a call with him. Not to sound harsh, but he demonstrated that he doesnt understand that variables arent visible outside of their block and he wasnt able to store a boolean in a variable.


I want this dude to get better, I want him to be excited, I want him to feel the good feeling in the tummy when he gets something working correctly.


Right now, though, we arent meeting our project deadlines because us more experienced need to help him out on basic things so often.


Im also worried that this way of us intervening with his work makes him acquire learned helplessness instead of becoming self sufficient in problem solving and googling.

These are not too far from what the actual numbers are, I've spent countless hours researching local jobs postings salaries, compensation, etc.  Total compensation for other jobs is 2-3x my current salary, and FAANG companies are 4x.

There are a lot of luxuries, but there are a lot of downsides too.  Primarily there is no one to learn from (or tell me no), and then the salary.  I've certainly dug myself a hole a few times before.

I left on good terms with my company A to follow some of my coworkers to a new company, B. Company B was not what I expected, and feel somewhat misled about the culture and state of affairs at the new company by my coworkers. I don't hold them responsible or have any ill will about it, especially since one of them was apologetic about not giving enough context.

I've known my current manager at company B for a couple of years. I respect him. He took care of me as best he could, and I'm not leaving because of him. I plan to inform him in the morning about my decision to leave.

How do I best handle this in a respectable way? What should my messaging be to my manager to let him know I'm leaving?

I was tempted to give them a more gracious 3 or 4 weeks notice, and leave my projects in a good state, so they get some value from my time with them, _and_ be honest with them about where I'm going. I don't expect to be done dirty, but anything is possible -- maybe they ask me to leave right away if I tell them where I'm going. 

I genuinely feel upset that I have disappointed two companies now, and two sets of managers. It truly wasn't my intention. But again, I also felt misled and pressured about the role at company B.

1.) Join the workforce
2.) Go to school for a CS related masters.
3.) Go to school for a BS in a foreign language (I don't care about job prospects but it's something I enjoy and will be an easy time for me).

Money isn't a concern, spouse and I have no credit/debt and have about a year of emergency savings, plus we're completely sustainable on my spouses salary alone. My concerns are:

1.) I might miss this easy opportunity to get a job directly dealing with CS and will have a harder time breaking into the workforce later. Also I hear Oahu doesn't have much of a tech scene so it'd be smarter to snag a job while I can.
2.) I'm just burnt on life right now. This past year of personal problems and going to school and working full time just wants me to take option 3. But I'd be willing to bear with option 1 if it means my future is easier, plus I won't be dealing with my personal issues or school anymore.

Me: ""Yes but honestly, I spent 0 time doing development and doing requirements gathering that wasn't done.""

Me: ""Well if I wasn't wasting my time doing the job of a project manager, I'd be doing development. Either bill for it, or take it on the nose. Not my problem.""

Reposting because didn't get enough replies. Please hear me out.. I'm currently a Regulatory Affairs Analyst at a medium sized company that manufacturers medical devices. I graduate in 2017 with a Bsc. in Biology and got a Masters in Regulatory Affairs in 2019. My current pay is decent imo, about \~$85,000, since I live in a MCOL area. No debt and about \~250k in savings. I've 5 years of experience but I've been heavily debating moving into a programming career.

Why? Long story short, I had early brushes with programming when I was young and hated it. I was scared of programming to the point that I made a mental block in my head and just told myself that it isn't my cup of tea. The only thing I liked at the time was Biology so ended up graduating with a Bsc. in Biology. I realized my degree wasn't probably worth much so figured I'll do a Masters to increase my job prospects and my income. I have a decent job now but I'm extremely burnt out of doing administrative work. I don't see it being challenging and my salary will probably top out at $120k-ish in 5 years. I'm single right now and have a lot of free time to do something productive on the side and figured I'll try programming again since I always sort of wanted to get past that mental challenge. I started doing a **Python** bootcamp on Udemy and I'm loving it! Looking back at programming after all these years has given me chance to think about it with a fresh perspective (instead of always being nervous/anxious about it. And hence, never trying to logically understand it).

I graduated with \~140 credits so if I go back to my old college to pursue a degree in CS, I only really have to take all CS 100 thru 400 level courses. I don't need to take any math, english or elective courses since I already fulfilled them with my current degree. I'm thinking may be 1 or 1.5 years of studying. So:

1. Does it make sense to go back? I have enough savings to sustain myself until I graduate. I'm thinking of extensively coding at home during the time I'm in school. Basically coding full time for at least a year, getting my foundations strong, doing practice exercises, learning back end frameworks like Django or Flask, etc.
2. I'll be 30/31 when I graduate. Will age be a factor when I'm trying to find a job? Do you think I can get a job after graduating that pays me similar to what I'm getting right now ($85,000)? I'm on the East Coast, Tri-State area.

I have one employee who is fresh out of school (less than a year). He is very nice and has a lot of potential, but he definitely needs improvement in some areas. 

My boss (his former boss) and others have made it very clear to me that he isn't living up to expectations. He would come in late, talk too much, not take initiative, lose files, etc.. After just 1.5 months, I had to have a sit down about these issues. He's since started to improve on these items in my eyes. I've held him accountable. I do not micro manage and trust him but also I don't sugar coat (not rude, but i am direct). We get along great in general and he's always very nice to me, texts me on weekends, etc.. I try to keep the employee vs. friend line drawn though just to be clear.

Fast forward to our 360 review, just weeks after my probation ended, and I find out last week that he scored me very low. My peers gave me a 3.3, my boss a 3.6, I gave myself a 3.2, but my employee gave me a 2.60. This is out of a total of 5. I'm not supposed to know his score of me, but my boss told me. (wish he hadn't).

I'm very bummed. It bothers me because in some areas I think he scored me too low. He also did my review the week after he asked me to leave early (3 hours) and i told him he would have to take his PTO to do that. He wanted me to just let him leave and make up the hours at home....but unfortunately he hasn't proven to me that he can be trusted to truly ""make up the hours"". He was very annoyed with me after that for a bit and I wonder if some of this score is based on that.

On the other hand, I was slightly nervous about his score of me because on some levels I know I haven't been a great manager. I've been here for 3 months and am just now getting comfortable in my role. the head of the company and my boss have both pulled me in so many directions that I just don't have much time. I'm always available to him and respond quickly to give him direction and advice, but because of the workload my weekly meetings with him are usually cut short or canceled. I hate this because I specifically told him I wanted to frequently meet, mentor, train, etc. so that he can get the skills he needs to be successful here and wherever he may want to go in the industry. 

I've never had a negative review in 10 years of working. Any advice on how to handle this type of criticism and how to improve? I know I need to dedicate more time to him. I thought about bringing that up to him during one of our meetings, just without him knowing that i know what he scored me.

Hello everyone, currently In community college and finished my first year. My second semester was a living hell, my first semester went great but I ended up failing 2 computer science classes last semester which through me into an ultra depressive few months that I am still trying to work out of.

I am currently on financial aid, and pretty much everything is being paid for which im extremely extremely greatful for.

I need to retake those two classes to get back on my own personal career track. If I take these 3 classes in the summer (calculus, programming and critical thinking) I’d be able to graduate still in 2 years. If I don’t I would imagine I have to do one more extra semester to get that done.

Completely unrelated to college but I assume a lot are going through, I’ve been having a smoking addiction these past months and it’s destroying my life. Im basically almost broke from the two semesters financial aid money (I was able to pay for my education, books and other personal expenditures). I’m shit with money and it’s something I’m. Praying I work on everyday to better, but if I go into the 3 classes over the summer I’d basically be 100% broke after book spending.

Is it worth it to go in the summer like this. I want to fix my gpa which retaking one of the classes would do, but I literally won’t have any money over the summer. I am currently trying to do my own personal game dev course and self learn because I rlly do want to get into comp sci despite hardships one goes when learning new skill. My parents don’t ask for rent as long as I’m in school and learning on my own. There is a lot of pressure and stress at home but I won’t go into detail for time sake. They don’t recommend me getting a job because they did the same and want Me  to study at home instead and pursue and work on something at home like a project or business instead of working for someone else and wasting time to develop yourself on someone else. 

This is an amazing dynamic and I’m so grateful but at times personal issues, family issues and finaincial stress get in the way. Since the start of COVID it’s been hard. We have had to move, lost jobs etc but everyday we work towards our dreams. I am really stressed and feel burned out, and I hate myself for even thinking this because I am just a lazy 19 year old college kid who knows nothing about the real world.

I feel stuck. Should i take the classes into the summer? i feel as if i dont i would feel extremely guilty for not doing so since my parents assumed I was going to for a while. I would also feel extremly like shit because of my failed classes being there the entire summer without me doing anything else towards the classes. i know summer classes aren't mandatory but i just dont know what to do. i also don't want to have $0 over the summer because of any expense that could come. my parents tell me as long as they see me deep into learning on my own and stuff that i wouldn't have to worry about that stuff. but as a young male, the concept of earning money and cash on hand is so attractive. if i do get a summer job i feel deep down they would be disspointed, and i also do really want to develop my own solo developing career. I am just stuck in this constant cycle of not knowing what to do, and in turn I just waste time doing none of the stuff i want. i am not sure if depression or anxiety is the asnwer to how I have been feeling lately, but it feels as if for the past few months my life is falling on top of me and I dont know what to do. 

i am constantly stressed, worried, anxious the worst is gonna happen. not sure if i should do A because B and C might happen. i also am fighting a smoking habit that i just cant break. i just feel so god damn helpless. 

would appreciate to hear anyones opinion, advice or anything. just feeling like theres no point anymore, and that i should just give up, go to minimum wage job, save up, work, go home, smoke, and repeat until im old and grey",True,False,False,cscareerquestions,t5_2sdpm,537415,public,self,"19, aspiring developer.

**My approach:**

Instead of getting internships and doing leet code (I'm an idiot lol), I just did projects or researched what I was passionate/obsessed about and helped out the family business (manufacturing). I also started applying for remote positions across the country, where the job market is a bit better.

The dots connected and I got a job offer for a software developer position in a research/manufacturing company! The technology they focus on is something I was obsessed with last year.  So, in the interview, I could talk about fairly niche topics in graphics/math/manufacturing.

Last Spring I got accepted into my dream internship program. My team was amazing, and I loved my job. I even got offered an extension to stay until December. Two weeks later, covid hit, and all interns were let go permanently by mid-April. 

I graduated in May with my bachelor's degree, and by August I started remotely as a full time firmware engineer at a well known company. In December, I moved 2,000 miles to be onsite. I'm not loving the job, but I figured a big name would look really good on a resume, as well as give me some decent experience. 

Just last week, I was offered a chance to come back to my dream internship. The company I was interning with was hit really hard by covid, and there haven't been any full time openings on my old team since I was let go. However, I would be re-joining my old team if I took the internship. This company is pretty big on hiring from within, and my best chance of getting a full time job with them in the future is by going through the internship program. But even then, it's not guaranteed. 

My question is, is it worth it? Is it worth leaving my full time, salaried position to chase this dream job? If I did leave my current job, take this internship, and then NOT convert to a full-time position at my dream job, how would that look on a resume to future employers?

I’m a new grad, but I didn’t major in CS. I had a data analysis/ web dev related internship, and did some game development in college, which helped me get the offer. I also took a few CS classes but didn’t do well in them.

I don’t code in my free time, so I’m rusty. There are a lot of fundamentals I lack a good understanding of (like OOP, inheritance, polymorphism). I also lack knowledge of theory like operating systems and networking. The BIGGEST thing I lack though, is problem solving skills. I’ve always struggled with breaking problems up into chunks, putting the solution together and getting my code to run.

I want to prepare as best as possible for this role, but I’m having trouble knowing where to start and how to get a comprehensive education online.

The team I’d be working on focuses on satellite communication solutions. The tech stack consists of COTs and customer hardware running on Linux-based systems. The backend software mostly runs as plane Java applications or microservice-based Typescript/Docker-based apps. Most of the frontend software was migrated to HTML/TypeScript-based web frontends based on Angular or React.

Currently my plan is to take a programming fundamentals course in Java to refresh and try to understand what I didn’t before. Then I was thinking I should do a project to practice and actually learn.
Then I’d do a web dev course and try to build a React app as a project.
I also need to gain knowledge on using Linux, CLI and Git commands, how satellite communication works, etc. I’m pretty much starting from scratch.

I have about 6 weeks to do all of this. 

So my questions:

Is it feasible to learn this much and do 2 projects in 6 weeks? How many hours do I need to put in weekly to achieve this?

Can you recommend any resources you used to get better at problem solving &amp; writing good code? (Specifically in Java or JavaScript)

4. Does the job entail coding? If yes, then what percentage of the job is coding and what technologies are used?
5. Is there some list of companies that hire quant traders? I know only about the popular ones like Jane Street and Citadel.
6. Do  all companies that hire quant traders pay them well? This seems to be  one of the highest paying professions, but I still don't understand why.  Do quant traders really possess such a rare skill?
7. How easy is it to switch from software engineering to quant trading and vice versa?

9. How's the demand in the industry for quant traders? Is it gonna go up or down in the future?

I have a bit of a dilemma with LinkedIn recruiters at the moment. I’m a 26yo technical lead at a very large international company, making a little over £50k plus benefits. Recently I’ve been getting a few offers through LinkedIn for jobs paying almost double this (albeit in a different part of the country) - I don’t want to move jobs right now for personal reasons (very turbulent life at the moment, I enjoy the work I do, I can live comfortably on my current wage for now, etc) but I don’t want to burn bridges with recruiters in case I do fancy a change a year or two down the line.

With this in mind, how do you guys deal with LinkedIn recruiters? Do you just ignore the messages completely? Respond saying “not right now but I’d like to keep in touch” (if so, how do I word this)?

As the title says, I’m debating whether or not to leave my first job. I graduated last year in Math and Statistics, with the hopes of going into data analytics and eventually data science or software development. I did risk management as well, but I’ve only worked with sql, excel/vba,some R, and and intro c++ course, so I’m trying to self study languages at this point.

Well, basically I never found a job (my coding skills aren’t advanced at all) so I tried a data analytics mentorship which was geared in media and got my first job as a media analyst at the end of the year. My coworkers and upper management are great and kind, lots of days off, pretty decent entry pay plus bonuses, rarely days where I work past 5. Only thing is the I’m not very fond of is the work. Its not bad but There isn’t much analytics aside using excel and making dashboards and pivot tables, and I feel like I’m not learning much anymore, mostly just media buying and planning..

Last week, a recruiter from a much bigger media company asked to interview me about a data analytics position, where you’d use python, sql, and more software which I’m interested in. The interview went well and I’m set to speak with the team lead tomorrow. If all goes well, I’m expected to join in two weeks after the offer.

If I do get the job, I’m not sure what to do..I’m starting to feel guilt even though I haven’t been offered anything yet. The new company will give might be the same salary or only a few thousands higher than what I’m currently making, but I feel the work may be more rewarding. A lot of glassdoor reviews say lower salary and terrible work life balance is typical of this media agency, which makes me a little nervous..

If given the opportunity, should I take the offer? Or stick with my company. My coworker says our boss is good with creating a career path based on our interests, but the next review is in two months, and even then I dont know what opportunities I could have, or how long it’ll take..I took to reddit bc I don’t have many people I could talk to about this so if you guys could tell me what you’d do in my situation that’d be lovely, thanks so much!",True,False,False,cscareerquestions,t5_2sdpm,537335,public,self,Leaving first job after 6 months?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/numlja/leaving_first_job_after_6_months/,all_ads,6,05438160-1232-11e5-b573-0e1422b8b60b,New Grad,,,,,,,
